In music, extended technique is unconventional, unorthodox, or non-traditional methods of singing or of playing musical instruments employed to obtain unusual sounds or timbres.Burtner, Matthew (2005). "Making Noise: Extended Techniques after Experimentalism ", NewMusicBox.org.

Composers’ use of extended techniques is not specific to contemporary music (for instance, Hector Berlioz’s use of col legno in his Symphonie Fantastique is an extended technique) and it transcends compositional schools and styles. Extended techniques have also flourished in popular music. Nearly all jazz performers make significant use of extended techniques of one sort or another, particularly in more recent styles like free jazz or avant-garde jazz. Musicians in free improvisation have also made heavy use of extended techniques.

Examples of extended techniques include bowing under the bridge of a string instrument or with two different bows, using key clicks on a wind instrument, blowing and overblowing into a wind instrument without a mouthpiece, or inserting objects on top of the strings of a piano.

Twentieth-century exponents of extended techniques include Henry Cowell (use of fists and arms on the keyboard, playing inside the piano), John Cage (prepared piano), and George Crumb. The Kronos Quartet, which has been among the most active ensembles in promoting contemporary American works for string quartet, frequently plays music which stretches the manner in which sound can be drawn out of instruments.

Examples 

 Vocal 

 Sprechstimme (speech-singing)
 overtone singing (harmonic singing, or vocal multiphonics)
 ululation
 beatboxing (vocal percussionists)
 growling
 screaming and shouting
 whispering
 panting
 whistling
 hissing
 clucking
 barking
 sucking

 Bowed string instruments 

 playing with a plectrum or pick
 playing with percussion sticks, mallets, or other objects
 bowing on the "wrong" side of the left hand fingers
 bowing behind the bridge
 bowing non-string parts of the instrument
 parallel rather than perpendicular bowing
 exaggerated vibrato
 snap pizzicato, also called Bartók pizzicato
 tapping or rubbing the soundboard of stringed instruments
 string scrapes with finger, nail, or object
 percussive effects on body of instrument
 tapping on the fingerboard
 "seagull" harmonic effects
 detuning a string while playing
 preparation
 resonance effects

 Plucked string instruments 
 using a bow
 playing with percussion sticks, mallets, or other objects
 playing on crossed strings (called "snare drum effect" on guitar)
 snap pizzicato, in which a string is pulled away from the fingerboard until it snaps back and strikes the fingerboard.
 string scrapes, a technique especially associated with electric guitar and electric bass, as played with a pick.
 percussive effects, such as drumming on a string instrument body 
 palm and finger muting ("pizzicato")
 tapping on the fingerboard
 string pops and slaps (fingerboard instruments)
 preparation of a guitar by inserting screws or pieces of metal in the bridge or between the strings.
 detuning a string while playing
 "3rd bridge", a guitar technique using the part of the string between the nut and the stopping finger; see Xenakis' cello piece Nomos Alpha for a similar effect.

 Piano 

 prepared piano, i.e., introducing foreign objects into the workings of the piano to change the sound quality
 string piano, i.e., striking, plucking, or bowing the strings directly, or any other direct manipulation of the strings
 resonance effects (whistling, singing or talking into the piano)
 silently depressing one or more keys, allowing the corresponding strings to vibrate freely, allowing sympathetic harmonics to sound
 touching the strings at node points to create harmonics
 percussive use of different parts of the piano, such as the outer rim
 slamming piano lid or keyboard cover
 microtones
 use of the palms, fists, or external devices to create tone clusters
 use of other materials to strike the keys
 pedal noises

 Woodwind instruments 
 multiphonics
 harmonics
 pitch bends ("lipping")
 noisily activating keys without blowing
 combination of a mouthpiece of one instrument with the main body of another, for example, using an alto saxophone mouthpiece on a standard trombone.
 flutter-tonguing, 
 breath noises
 blowing a disengaged mouthpiece or reed
 singing through the instrument while playing
 internal muting
 key or tone-hole slap – percussive sound made by slapping a key or keys against their tone holes
 circular breathing

 Brass instruments 
 singing through the instrument while playing
 exaggerated brass head-shakes
 noisily activating valves without blowing
 pitch bends ("lipping")
 combination of a mouthpiece of one instrument with the main body of another, for example, using a French horn mouthpiece on a standard bassoon
 flutter tonguing
 circular breathing
 double buzz
 half-valve playing
 unconventional mutes or other foreign objects in the bell (e.g. plumbing parts)
 breath noises
 slap tonguing
 blowing a disengaged mouthpiece

Percussion
 rudimental or "dynamic" double bass on the drum set, using hand rudiments such as double stroke rolls and flam taps and playing them with the feet
 stacking 2 or more cymbals, one on top of the other, to change the sound properties of the instrument
 bowed vibraphone, cymbals, and gongs
 resonance effects (e.g., cymbal played on a timpani; cow bell struck against a bass drum, etc.)
 pitch bends on mallet percussion
 harmonics
 custom-built percussion mallets, occasionally made for vibraphone or tubular bells (and other pitched-percussion in increasingly rare circumstances) which feature more than one mallet-head, and so are capable of producing multiple pitches and difficult chords (though usually only the chords they were designed to play). These mallets are seldom used, and percussionists sometimes make them themselves when they are needed. When implemented, they are usually only used once or twice in an entire work, and are alternated with conventional mallets; usually they are used only when playing a different instrument in each hand.
 striking a gong and then inserting the vibrating metal into a tub of water, creating a glissando.
 placing a cymbal on a timpani head

 Electronic 
 added electronics or MIDI control
 Turntablism, such as scratching records or otherwise manipulating a record or turntable platter, often done in combination with a DJ mixer, to create unique sound effects and rhythms
 Using a "kill switch" on an electric guitar to create quasi-scratching rhythmic sounds.
 Circuit bending: DIY experimenting with electronic keyboards and electronic toys.
 playing electric instruments unplugged, or amplifying acoustical parts of normally electronic instruments (e.g. finger noise on the keys)
 exploitation of inherent equipment "defects" (e.g., deliberately driving digital equipment into aliasing; exaggerating hum or hiss coming from speakers, acoustic feedback, key click on a Hammond organ etc.)

 Organ 
Playing on stops that are partially drawn (has an effect only if the stops are on purely mechanical action, with a slider windchest).
Manipulating stops while holding one or more notes (possible on most organs, but most effective if the stops are on purely mechanical action, with a slider chest).

 Other instruments 

 unusual harmonics
 glissandi, tuner glissando
