He served as a State Senator from 1965 to 1972 and as a United States representative from Arizona from 1973 to 1977.\n\nEarly life and career\nBorn in Oak Park, Illinois, Conlan was the son of Ruth (Anderson) and Hall of Fame baseball umpire Jocko Conlan. He attended Illinois public schools and received a B.S. from Northwestern University, where he joined Delta Upsilon. He later graduated from Harvard Law School, received a Fulbright Scholarship to study at the University of Cologne, and studied at The Hague Academy of International Law. Conlan was admitted to the Illinois bar in 1954 and commenced practice in Chicago. He then served as a captain in the U.S. Army from 1956 to 1961. Conlan has also taught geo-politics and American foreign policy at Arizona State University and the University of Maryland. He continued to practice law in Phoenix, Arizona. Conlan served in the Arizona Senate from 1965 to 1973.Arizona State Library-Arizona Legislators Past and Present\n\nU.S. House of Representatives\nIn 1976, he ran for the United States Senate to succeed retiring Republican Senator Paul Fannin. He was opposed in the Republican primary by fellow U.S. Representative Sam Steiger which Conlan narrowly lost.  The general election was won by former Pima County Attorney Dennis DeConcini.\n\nDuring his time in Congress, he became a critic of the elementary school curriculum known as Man: A Course of Study, which taught students about the lifestyle and culture of the Netsilik Inuit. At its peak in 1972, the curriculum was being taught to 400,000 students nationwide. Conlan claimed the program had an ideological bias and promoted cultural relativism. This ignited a controversy centered in Phoenix, Arizona, that led the National Science Foundation to cut funding for the curriculum in 1975, after which it ceased to be used.“Through These Eyes,” Dir.

It was founded in 1904 by Hiram Watson Sibley (1845-1932), son of industrialist Hiram Sibley (1807-1888), and is said to be the largest university music library in the US.\n\nHistory\nMr. Sibley was prompted to found a music collection after Elbert Newton, a Rochester, NY church organist, suggested to him that such a collection would be of value to Rochester's music-loving public. Lenti, Vincent (2004). For the Enrichment of Community Life: George Eastman and the Founding of the Eastman School of Music (Rochester, NY: Meliora Press.) The resulting collection was originally situated in Sibley Hall on the Arts College campus of the University of Rochester serving both the Rochester community and the University.  In January, 1922, following an agreement by ESM founder George Eastman (1854-1932) and Hiram Watson Sibley, the collection was formally merged with the Eastman School of Music and was moved from its original home to the newly built Eastman School of Music in downtown Rochester.\n\nBy 1937 the library had outgrown its space within the Eastman School's main building, and an annex was erected at 44 Swan Street, the adjacent block. At that time the library was renamed from Sibley Musical Library to Sibley Music Library.The Sibley Music Library: A World Collection University of Rochester library bulletin Volume XXXIII, 1980 Even after major renovations made to that building in 1976, the library once again outgrew its space, and eventually plans were made to erect a third building. The library moved to its current location in 1989 and now occupies 45,000 square feet (4,000 m²) on the 2nd, 3rd and 4th floors of the Miller Center building, formerly known as Eastman Place (re-named in 2004).Davidson, Mary Wallace. “The Research Collections of the Sibley Music Library of the Eastman School of Music, University of Rochester.” The Library Quarterly 64, no. 2 (April 1994): 177-194.\n\nHead librarians\n\nBarbara Duncan, the first librarian was also a founder of the Music Library Association.\nWomen’s History Month: Honoring the Women of Sibley Music LibraryEastman School of Music.\n Barbara Duncan (1922-1947)\n Ruth T.

They reside in the central Sierra Nevada, in the watershed area of the Feather and American Rivers and in Humbug Valley. In Maiduan languages, maidu means \"person\".\nthumb|Map of Maidu peoples\n\nLocal division\nThe Maidu people are geographically dispersed into many subgroups or bands who live among and identify with separate valleys, foothills, and mountains in northeastern Central California. The three subcategories of Maidu are:\n The Nisenan or Southern Maidu occupied the whole of the American, Bear, and Yuba River drainages. They live in lands that were previously home to the Martis.\n The Northeastern or Mountain Maidu, also known as Yamani Maidu, lived on the upper north and middle forks of the Feather River.\n The Konkow (Koyom'kawi/Concow) occupied a valley between present-day Cherokee, and Pulga, along the north fork of the Feather River and its tributaries. The Mechupda live in the area of Chico, California.\n\nPopulation\n\nthumb|Original title: Maidu Headmen with Treaty Commissioners--widely regarded as charlatans--O. M. Wozencraft is center front; around August 1, 1851 at Rancho Arroyo Chico.\nEstimates for the pre-contact populations of most native groups in California have varied substantially. Alfred L. Kroeber estimated the 1770 population of the Maidu (including the Konkow and Nisenan) as 9,000.Kroeber (1925:883) Sherburne F. Cook raised this figure slightly, to 9,500.Cook (1976:179)\n\nKroeber reported the population of the Maidu in 1910 as 1,100. The 1930 census counted 93, following decimation by infectious diseases and social disruption. As of 1995, the Maidu population had recovered to an estimated 3,500.\n\nCulture\n Baskets and basket making \nThe Maidu women were exemplary basketweavers, weaving highly detailed and useful baskets in sizes ranging from thimbles to huge ones 10 or more feet in diameter. The weaving on some of these baskets is so fine that a magnifying glass is needed to see the strands. In addition to making closely woven, watertight baskets for cooking, they made large storage baskets, bowls, shallow trays, traps, cradles, hats, and seed beaters. They used dozens of different kinds of wild plant stems, barks, roots and leaves. Some of the more common were fern roots, red bark of the redbud, white willow twigs and tule roots, hazel twigs, yucca leaves, brown marsh grassroots, and sedge roots. By combining these different kinds of plants, the women made geometric designs on their baskets in red, black, white, brown or tan.\n\nMaidu elder Marie Potts explains, \"The coiled and twining systems were both used, and the products were sometimes handsomely decorated according to the inventiveness and skill of the weaver and the materials available, such as feathers of brightly plumaged birds, shells, quills, seeds or beads- almost anything that could be attached.\"\n\nSubsistence\nthumb|A mortar ground into the solid rock near a stream\nLike many other California tribes, the Maidu were primarily hunters and gatherers and did not farm. They practiced grooming of their gathering grounds, with fire as a primary tool for this purpose. They tended local groves of oak trees to maximize production of acorns, which were their principal dietary staple after being processed and prepared.\n\nAccording to Maidu elder Marie Potts:\n\nPreparing acorns as the food was a long and tedious process that was undertaken by the women and children. The acorns had to be shelled, cleaned, and then ground into meal. This was done by pounding them with a pestle on a hard surface, generally a hollowed-out stone. The tannic acid in the acorns was leached out by spreading the meal smoothly on a bed of pine needles laid over sand. Cedar or fir boughs were placed across the meal and warm water was poured all over, a process that took several hours, with the boughs distributing the water evenly and flavoring the meal.\n\nThe Maidu used the abundance of acorns to store large quantities for harder times. Above-ground acorn granaries were created by the weavers.\n\nBesides acorns, which provided dietary starch and fat, the Maidu supplemented their acorn diet with edible roots or tubers (for which they were nicknamed \"Digger Indians\" by European immigrants), and other plants and tubers. The women and children also collected seeds from the many flowering plants, and corms from wildflowers also were gathered and processed as part of their diet. The men hunted deer, elk, antelope, and smaller game, within a spiritual system that respected the animals. The men captured fish from the many streams and rivers, as they were a prime source of protein. Salmon were collected when they came upstream to spawn; other fish were available year-round.\n\nHousing\nEspecially higher in the hills and the mountains, the Maidu built their dwellings partially underground, to gain protection from the cold. These houses were sizable, circular structures 12 to 18 feet in diameter, with floors, dug as much as 3 feet below ground level. Once the floor of the house was dug, a pole framework was built. It was covered by pinebark slabs. A sturdy layer of earth was placed along the base of the structure. A central fire was prepared in the house at ground level. It had a stone-lined pit and bedrock mortar to hold heat for food preparation.\n\nFor summer dwelling, a different structure was built from cut branches tied together and fastened to sapling posts, then covered with brush and soil. The summer shelters were built with the principal opening facing east to catch the rising sun, and to avoid the heat of afternoon sun.\n\nSocial organization\nMaidu lived in small villages or bands with no centralized political organization. Leaders were typically selected from the pool of men who headed the local Kuksu cult. They did not exercise day-to-day authority, but were primarily responsible for settling internal disputes and negotiating over matters arising between villages.\n\nReligion\nThe primary religious tradition was known as the Kuksu cult. This central California religious system was based on a male secret society. It was characterized by the Kuksu or \"big head\" dances. Maidu elder Marie Mason Potts says that the Maidu are traditionally a monotheistic people: \"they greeted the sunrise with a prayer of thankfulness; at noon they stopped for meditation, and at sunset, they communed with Kadyapam and gave thanks for blessings throughout the day.\" A traditional spring celebration for the Maidu was the Bear Dance when the Maidu honored the bear coming out of hibernation. The bear's hibernation and survival through the winter symbolized perseverance to the Maidu, who identified with the animal spiritually.\n\nThe Kuksu cult system was also followed by the Pomo and the Patwin among the Wintun. Missionaries later forced the peoples to adopt Christianity, but they often retained elements of their traditional practices.\n\n Traditional narratives \nStories of K'odojapem/World-maker and Wepam/Trickster Coyote are particularly prominent in Maidu traditional narratives.\"Maidu Indian Legends.\" Native Languages of the Americas. Retrieved 30 Dec 2011. Shipley, William. The Maidu Indian Myths and Stories of Hánc'ibyjim. 1991. (w/ foreword by Gary Snyder)\n\nLanguages\n\nThe Maidu spoke a language that some linguists believe was related to the Penutian family. While all Maidu spoke a form of this language, the grammar, syntax, and vocabulary differed sufficiently that Maidu separated by large distances or by geographic features that discouraged travel might speak dialects that were nearly mutually unintelligible.\n\nThe four principal divisions of the language were Northeastern Maidu or Yamonee Maidu (known simply as Maidu); Southern Maidu or Nisenan; Northwestern Maidu or Konkow; and Valley Maidu or Chico.\n\nRock art\nThe Maidu inhabited areas in the northeastern Sierra Nevada. Many examples of indigenous rock art and petroglyphs have been found here. Scholars are uncertain about whether these date from previous indigenous populations of peoples or were created by the Maidu people. The Maidu incorporated these works into their cultural system, and believe that such artifacts are real, living energies that are an integral part of their world.\n\nTribes\n\nFederally recognized \n Berry Creek Rancheria of Maidu Indians\n Enterprise Rancheria of Maidu Indians of California\n Greenville Rancheria of Maidu Indians of California\n Mechoopda Indian Tribe of Chico Rancheria\n Mooretown Rancheria of Maidu Indians of California\n Shingle Springs Band of Miwok Indians, Shingle Springs Rancheria (Verona Tract)\n Susanville Indian Rancheria\n United Auburn Indian Community of the Auburn Rancheria\n\nNot federally recognized\n Honey Lake Maidu Tribe\n KonKow Valley Band of Maidu IndiansKonkow Valley Band of Maidu Indians\n Nisenan of Nevada City Rancheria\n Strawberry Valley Band of Pakan'yani Maidu (aka Strawberry Valley Rancheria)Strawberry Valley Rancheria\n Tsi Akim Maidu Tribe of Taylorsville Rancheria\n United Maidu Nation\n Colfax-Todds Valley Consolidated Tribe of the Colfax RancheriaColfaxRancheria.com\n\nNotable Maidu people \n\n Dalbert Castro (Nisenan), artist, painter\n Wallace Clark (Koyom'kawi yepom), traditional arts\n Frank Day (Konkow), artist\n Harry Fonseca (Nisenan/Miwok), artist, painter\n Janice Gould (Konkow Maidu), artist\n Judith Lowry (Mountain Maidu/Achomawi), artist, painter\n Jacob A.

    "clean_text": "Musette Brooks Gregory (October 10, 1876 – July 26, 1921) was an African-American suffragist and civil rights activist.\n\nBiography \nGregory was born on 10 October 1876 to Eugene and Oceanna Everett Brooks.  The family lived in Washington, D.C., where Musette attended public school. While living in Washington, D.C., Gregory was a principal's clerk and the supervisor of first-year work for the 13th District public schools. As a clerk, Gregory was exposed to teaching, and would later become a teacher herself. Gregory was also very involved in community service. She held leadership positions in the Music School Settlement in New York and was a member of the board of the Old Folks’ Home of Newark. She was a member and ex-President of the Phyllis Wheatley Literary Society of Newark. On June 23, 1904, Gregory married Eugene Monroe Gregory, a Harvard University graduate. While Musette Gregory was teaching, Eugene Gregory was enrolled in Columbian University (now George Washington University) to study law. Originally, the couple lived in Trenton, but they moved to Newark in 1910. They had no children.\n\nGregory died on July 26, 1921, in New York. Because of her significant achievements with civil rights and suffrage, the Federation of Colored Women’s Clubs named a scholarship after her.\nthumb|New Jersey Women's Suffrage Group\n\nSuffrage work \nThroughout her career, Gregory was involved with several women’s organizations, especially in New Jersey. In addition to her work in New Jersey, she actively worked alongside social services in New York. In 1919, she attended a rally in New Jersey, where she was elected to the executive committee for the New Jersey Suffrage Ratification Committee. The goal of the NJSRC was to help elect men that supported the 19th amendment. They wanted them to be in office before and during the election to get more voters. The NJSRC worked in partnership with organizations such as the New Jersey Suffrage Association, the State Federation of Women’s Club, the State Federation of Colored Women’s Club, and the State Women’s Christian Temperance Movement. In addition to her suffrage work, Gregory was the superintendent of the Working Girls’ Home in New York.\n\nCivil rights work \nthumb|The Cathedral of St. John the Divine\nCivil rights work was important to Gregory. She became the secretary and chairman of the executive board for the New Jersey Foundation of Colored Women’s Clubs, the oldest African-American secular organization in existence today. This organization is committed to addressing the needs of black women. One of Gregory's main projects was her work with the Colored Mission of the Diocesan Auxiliary of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York, where she became the superintendent. Under this mission, she worked at the Home for the Working Girls at 132 West 131st Street, New York City, where she helped protect young working class African-American girls. The mission helped keep them out of prostitution by preparing them for work with cooking, sewing, and housekeeping. They also provided the girls counseling. Gregory was highly involved with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, becoming the Vice President of the Newark Branch.\n\nDeath \nGregory died in 1921 on July 26 after a long illness. An obit was published in The Crisis and the Newark Evening News, among others.",

He was educated at Rugby School before spending time in the British Army's medical department, becoming surgeon's mate in June 1794. He then took his medical degree at Peterhouse and Gonville and Caius College at the University of Cambridge, along with London lectures from George Fordyce and Andrew Marshal and time in Edinburgh, finally graduating MD in 1803.\n\nOctober 1795 saw him made physician to the forces, accompanying Admiral Christian's fleet to Santo Domingo and being sent to Gibraltar in 1804 to treat a contagious fever outbreak there. In April 1806 he came back to England, where in 1809 George III knighted him and appointed him chief of the medical department of the army at Cádiz, then in the midst of the Peninsular War. He then became deputy inspector (March 1813) then inspector (April 1813) of hospitals before retiring on half pay in 1814. Having been a first-hand eyewitness of epidemics at Cádiz, Málaga and Gibraltar, he then published Reports of the pestilential disorder of Andalusia, which appeared at Cádiz in the years 1800, 1804, 1810, and 1813 (1815). Arthur Wellesley appointed Fellowes deputy county lieutenant for Hampshire and Mrs Piozzi left Fellowes her manuscripts and copies of her writings with handwritten notes in 1821, with Fellowes becoming her literary executor.\n\nFellowships\nHe was elected to the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1800, the Royal College of Physicians in 1805 and the Royal Society in 1816.\n\nMarriage and issue\nIn 1816, he married Elizabeth, the eldest daughter of Joseph James, of Adbury House, Hampshire, and sister-in-law to the geologist William Henry Fitton.

A day later, however, Leeds United failed to beat Reading at Elland Road, which saw Sheffield United promoted back to the Premiership after many disappointments in the previous few seasons.\n\nKit\nUnited's kit was manufactured by French company Le Coq Sportif and sponsored by HFS Loans.\n\nPlayers\nFirst-team squad\nSquad at end of season\n\nLeft club during season\n\n}\n\nReserve squad\nThe following players did not appear for the first-team this season.\n\nTransfers\n\nIn\n\nSummer\nSquad #PositionPlayerTransferred fromFeeDateSource4343791924\n\nWinter\nSquad #PositionPlayerTransferred fromFeeDateSource273814\n\nFinal league table\n\nResults\nSheffield United's score comes first\n\nLegend\nWinDrawLoss\n\nFootball League Championship\nDateOpponentVenueResultAttendanceScorers 6 August 2005 Leicester CityH4–118,224Gray (pen), Kabba (pen), Ifill, Bromby 9 August 2005 BurnleyA2–111,802Shipperley, Morgan 13 August 2005 Queens Park RangersA1–213,497Kabba 20 August 2005 Preston North EndH2–120,519Shipperley, Webber 27 August 2005 Coventry CityH2–117,739Kabba, Unsworth (pen) 29 August 2005 Crewe AlexandraA3–17,501Shipperley, Quinn, Kabba 10 September 2005 Ipswich TownH2–021,059Kabba (2) 13 September 2005 Brighton & Hove AlbionA1–06,553Jagielka 17 September 2005 WatfordA3–215,399Jagielka, Ifill, Carlisle (own goal) 24 September 2005 Derby CountyH2–122,192Unsworth, Ifill 27 September 2005 Plymouth ArgyleH2–020,111Shipperley, Quinn 1 October 2005 ReadingA1–222,068Kabba 15 October 2005 Wolverhampton WanderersH1–025,533Shipperley 18 October 2005 MillwallA4–09,148Webber (2), Péricard, Quinn 21 October 2005 Leeds UnitedA1–123,600Kabba 29 October 2005 Cardiff CityH0–025,311 1 November 2005 Luton TownH4–022,554Jagielka (2), Morgan, Péricard 5 November 2005 Crystal PalaceA3–220,344Jagielka, Ifill, Shipperley 19 November 2005 MillwallH2–222,292Unsworth, Webber 22 November 2005 Wolverhampton WanderersA0–024,240 26 November 2005 Leicester CityA2–422,382Kabba, Webber 3 December 2005 Sheffield WednesdayH1–030,558Quinn 10 December 2005 BurnleyH3–023,118Shipperley (2), Webber 16 December 2005 Preston North EndA0–014,378 26 December 2005 Norwich CityH1–326,505Jagielka 28 December 2005 SouthamptonA1–027,443Shipperley 31 December 2005 Stoke CityH2–121,279Montgomery, Morgan 3 January 2006 Hull CityA3–121,929Ifill, Webber, Armstrong 14 January 2006 Ipswich TownA1–123,794Webber 21 January 2006 Brighton & Hove AlbionH3–127,514Jagielka, Ifill, Tonge 1 February 2006 Derby CountyA1–026,275Akinbiyi 6 February 2006 WatfordH1–420,791Ifill 11 February 2006 Plymouth ArgyleA0–015,017 14 February 2006 ReadingH1–125,011Dyer 18 February 2006 Sheffield WednesdayA2–133,439Tonge, Akinbiyi 25 February 2006 Queens Park RangersH2–325,360Akinbiyi, Bircham (own goal) 3 March 2006 Crewe AlexandraH0–022,691 11 March 2006 Coventry CityA0–223,506 18 March 2006 Norwich CityA1–225,346Armstrong 25 March 2006 SouthamptonH3–022,824Jagielka, Ifill, Shipperley 1 April 2006 Stoke CityA1–117,544Webber 8 April 2006 Hull CityH3–226,324Shipperley, Ifill, Unsworth 14 April 2006 Cardiff CityA1–011,006Webber 18 April 2006 Leeds UnitedH1–129,329Bakke (own goal) 22 April 2006 Luton TownA1–110,248Tonge 30 April 2006 Crystal PalaceH1–027,120Morgan\n\nFA Cup\n\n+RoundDateOpponentVenueResultAttendanceGoalscorersR37 January 2006 Colchester UnitedH1–211,820Kabba\n\nLeague Cup\n\n+RoundDateOpponentVenueResultAttendanceGoalscorersR123 August 2005 Boston UnitedH1–06,014RossR220 September 2005 Shrewsbury TownA0–0 (won 4–3 on pens)4,250R325 October 2005 ReadingA0–211,607",

After touring with Ron Sexsmith, playing the 2013 SXSW festival, Lollapalooza festival, releasing two music videos and an additional single, she finished the year by playing the Austin City Limits Music Festival.\n\nIn 2014, Waggoner signed a deal with Beijing-based label Pocket Records, and toured the entire country of China in partnership with Pocket Records for distribution of her albums Heal for the Honey and Go Easy Little Doves.\n\nDuring 2015, the Nashville-based chamber music ensemble CHATTERBIRD commissioned Waggoner to compose a piece consisting of instrumentation for woodwinds, strings, and piano entitled \"Minor-Born\".

    "clean_text": "Brian Nestande (January 10, 1964 – March 6, 2024) was an American consultant and politician who was a Republican California State Assemblyman representing the 42nd district.\n\nEarly life, education, and early political career\nBrian Nestande was born in Newport Beach, California, on January 10, 1964., California Library Association. Retrieved 19 September 1964. He grew up in a political family. His father, Bruce Nestande, was a state legislator and Orange County Supervisor during the 1970s and 1980's. Nestande graduated from Canyon High School in Anaheim in 1982. Nestande earned his Bachelor of Arts in political science from Cal State Fullerton in 1991.\n\nImmediately after graduating from college, Nestande obtained a job as Deputy Campaign Manager of the successful congressional campaign of Michael Huffington in Santa Barbara County. In 1994, Nestande managed the successful congressional campaign of then-Palm Springs Mayor Sonny Bono. Nestande went to work in Bono's office as Chief of Staff until Bono's death in early 1998. Bono's widow, Mary Bono Mack, was elected to succeed Sonny, and Nestande served as her chief of staff from 1998 until 2000.\n\nIn 2000, Nestande built a government affairs consulting business named Nestande and Associates which was headquartered in Palm Desert. He represented a variety of clients working on issues involving alternative energy, health care, telecommunications as well as on other projects and issues in Riverside County.\n\nCalifornia State Assembly\nElections\n2008\nIn 2008, Nestande ran for the 64th State Assembly district. He defeated businesswoman Kelly McCarty in the Republican primary 68%-32%. He won the general election unopposed.\n2010\nIn 2010, he won the Republican primary, defeating Jeffrey Lemasters Tahir 76%-24%. He won re-election to a second term defeating Jose Medina 57%-43%.\n2012\nAfter redistricting, he decided to run in the newly redrawn California's 42nd State Assembly district. He won re-election to a third term, defeating Democrat Mark Orozco 55%-45%.\n\nTenure\nThe first bill Nestande introduced in Sacramento was to limit the number of bills a legislator could introduce. Nestande later led a bipartisan coalition that closed a loophole on out-of-state businesses.\n\nIn January 2011, Nestande criticized a proposal to cut in-home supportive services. He sponsored legislation to aid the Salton Sea restoration. He proposed legislation that would create online education standards, increasing college access to those unable to participate in traditional classroom instruction. In June 2014, Nestande expressed concern about the potential for money in the Governor's budget to be diverted from tech education programs.\n\nNestande argued that the state government should include unfunded liabilities when making spending decisions.\n\nIn January 2014, Nestande called for a hearing about the 43 employees with a criminal record hired by Covered California, the California state health exchange administering the Affordable Care Act in that state. In October 2013, he sponsored legislation requiring lawmakers who want legislative health care coverage to enroll through the Covered California exchange, saying \"If we truly want to understand how the ACA is working and being implemented, there is no better way than to enroll in the exchange along with the people.\"\n\nCommittee assignments\n2013\nBudget\nGovernmental Organization, Vice-chair\nHealth\nInsurance\nRevenue and Taxation\n\n2014 congressional election\n\nNestande announced in May 2013 that he would challenge first-term representative Raul Ruiz, D-Palm Desert, to represent California's 36th congressional district in the United States House of Representatives. Ruiz defeated longtime incumbent Republican Mary Bono Mack in 2012.\n\nNestande, described by the Press Enterprise as the moderate candidate, received more votes than the conservative Ray Haynes, a former state assemblyman, in the blanket primary. Nestande won 34% of the vote to Haynes' 16%.\n\nIn September 2014, Roll Call wrote that Nestande \"has proved to be one of the cycle’s more disappointing candidates\" in terms of fundraising, but a campaign spokesperson in October 2014 told the Desert Sun that there was a \"strong finance plan for the end game.\" The campaign also stated that opponent Ruiz is receiving financial contributions from outside forces, \"while more than 90 percent of Nestande's money is from California.\"\n\nIn October 2014, the Press Enterprise offered their endorsement to Nestande who they write is \"best-suited to protecting taxpayers’ money, tackling the federal government’s mounting spending and debt and generally keeping government from hampering job growth and interfering in individuals’ personal affairs.\"\n\nPersonal life\nNestande was the son of politician Bruce Nestande, himself a former California assemblyman and Orange County Supervisor.\n\nNestande resided in Riverside County with his wife Gina and their seven children.  Gina was elected to the Palm Desert City Council in November 2016 and became mayor in December 2019.\n\nNestande died in Palm Desert on March 6, 2024, at the age of 60.Former state Assemblymember Brian Nestande of Palm Desert dies at 60\n\nThe Riverside County Coroner’s Office identified the cause of death as \"multiple substance intoxication, including fentanyl and cocaine.\"",

    "clean_text": "Pearl Binder, Baroness Elwyn-Jones (pronounced ; 28 June 1904 – 25 January 1990)\"Pearl Binder\", BFI.org.uk; accessed 11 February 2018. was a British writer, illustrator, stained-glass artist, lithographer, sculptor and a champion of the Pearly Kings and Queens.\n\nBinder was a well-known character who had a lifelong fascination with the East End of London, where she settled in the 1920s. In 1974, she became Lady Elwyn-Jones, when her husband, the politician and lawyer Elwyn Jones, was appointed Lord Chancellor and made a life peer, taking the title Baron Elwyn-Jones.\n\nEarly life\nPearl \"Polly\" Binder was born in Salford in Greater Manchester. Her father was Jacob Binderevski, a Jewish tailor who came to Britain in 1890 and shortly afterwards became a British citizen. Her mother's name, origins and profession are not recorded in any of the artist's biographies.\n\nCareer\nBinder moved to London after the first world war and studied art at Central School of Art and Design, with a focus on lithography. In this time Binder drew scenes from everyday life in London that she made into lithographs. She published a series that illustrated \"The Real East End\" by Thomas Burke, a popular writer who ran a pub in Poplar at the time. Binder's illustrations are an intimate, first-hand portrayal of grimy London life in that era. In 1933 Binder was one of the founders of the left-wing Artists' International Association.Paul Jobling and David Crowley,Graphic Design: reproduction and representation since 1800. Manchester, New York: Manchester University Press, pg. 128; \n\nIn 1937, Binder was involved in the earliest days of television broadcasting for children. That year, she co-presented Clothes-Line with the fashion historian James Laver. This live six-part series was the first television programme on the history of fashion. As she did not give birth to her daughter Josephine until 6 January 1938 – less than a month after the last episode transmitted – Binder could well have been the first heavily pregnant woman to appear on television.Taylor, Lou, Establishing Dress History, chapter 2 (Manchester 2002); \n\nIn the course of her life, Binder travelled extensively in Russia and China, designed a musical, designed costumes for a theatre company, wrote stories for children, designed a Pearly mug and plate for Wedgwood, and instigated and executed a series of armorial windows at the House of Lords.\n\nPersonal life\nIn 1937, she married Elwyn Jones. They had three children: fashion historian Lou Taylor, artist and activist Dan Jones, and the children's author Josephine Gladstone, whose books she illustrated. After her death, her son-in-law, Joe Taylor recalled, \"She was a woman who had great concern for others, especially women - she was a very keen supporter of women's rights\", always keeping the name Pearl Binder next to her husband's name on the plaque outside their flat.\n\nDeath\nBinder died in Brighton on 25 January 1990 aged 86, seven weeks after the death of her husband.\"Jones, (Frederick) Elwyn, Baron Elwyn-Jones (1909–1989)\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004.\n\nPublications\nAs illustrator\n\nAs author and illustrator\n\n – Japanese translation of Dressing up, dressing down",

A number of galls are often found next to each other on the same or different plant structures, and they may coalesce. The galls are mainly found around the growing apex and exhibit a wide range of forms, dependent on the organ in which they are situated.\n\nLife-cycle\nthumb|A typical cecidomyiid laying eggs on grass\nWhite larvae live gregariously in each gall, feeding upon the plant cell contents. The first generation galls are seen in spring. When larvae reach maturity, they leave the gall to pupate in the soil. Two or more generations per year are common. The last generation in autumn hibernates in the soil as larvae, pupate in spring and emerge as adults to start the next spring generation.Darlington, Page 141\n\nPredators and inquilines\nSometimes larvae of other gall midge species are found in the galls together with larvae of the gall inducer. They may be inquilines, such as the obligate associate Ametrodiplosis urticae, or they may be predators, such as Lestodiplosis urticae.\n\nDistribution\nThe nettle pouch gall has a Eurosiberian distribution. It is widely distributed in Central and Western Europe, but the distribution extends into Southern Siberia.",

    "title": "Alvin Baltrop",
    "clean_text": "Alvin Baltrop (December 11, 1948 – February 1, 2004) was an American photographer. Baltrop's work focused on the dilapidated Hudson River piers and gay men during the 1970s and 1980s prior to the AIDS crisis.\n\nEarly life\nBaltrop was born in 1948 at the old Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx. He discovered his love of photography in junior high school, learning different techniques from older photographers in his neighborhood and teaching himself to develop photos.\n\nCareer\nBaltrop enlisted in the Navy in 1969 as a medic during the Vietnam War and continued taking photos, mainly of his friends in sexually provocative poses. He built his own developing lab in the sick bay, using medic trays for developing trays. After his time in the Navy, Baltrop worked odd jobs as a street vendor, a jewelry designer, a printer, and a cab driver. In 1973, Baltrop enrolled in the School of Visual Arts, where he studied until 1975. Because he wanted to spend more time taking photos at the Hudson River piers, he quit his job as a cab driver to become a self-employed mover. He would park his van at the piers for days at a time, living out of his van to take pictures.\n\nFrom 1975 through 1986, Baltrop took photographs of the West Side piers, where he was a well-known member of the community. He knew every person that he photographed, and people often volunteered to be his subjects. Younger boys and men at the piers often confided in him about their sexual orientation, their relationships with their families, their housing status, and their work. The piers saw cruising, anonymous sex, and occasional art interventions.Green, Kate. \"Alvin Baltrop.\" Art Papers Magazine, vol. 36, no. 6, Nov/Dec2012, p. 55. His photographs not only captured human personalities, but also the aesthetics of the dilapidated piers.\n\nBaltrop captured the gay cruising spots and hookup culture that existed in New York City before the AIDS epidemic. His life work is a snapshot of gay, African-American, and New York City history.\n\nBaltrop struggled to make his way in the art world, facing racism from the white gay art world. Gay curators often rejected his work, accused him of stealing it, or stole his work themselves.\n\nLate in the 1990s, New York City artist John Drury, who knew Baltrop from their shared neighborhood—Drury living on Third Street with his wife, and Baltrop on Second Street, in lower Manhattan—befriended the artist and recognized the photographer's unique abilities, nominating him for a Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation Award for the Arts. Baltrop had few exhibits in his lifetime; his work gained international fame only after his death.\n\nPosthumous attention\nBaltrop was interviewed for Joseph Lovett's Gay Sex in the 70s (2006), appearing posthumously alongside other gay artists like Tom Bianchi, Barton Benes, and Larry Kramer.\n\nIn 2008, University of Rochester art professor Douglas Crimp wrote an article about Baltrop for Artforum magazine that regenerated interest in Baltrop's work.\n\nIn 2012, the artist's solo exhibition titled Perspectives 179— Alvin Baltrop: Dreams into Glass in the Contemporary Art Museum Houston included almost 100 gelatin silver prints that were shot between 1969 and 1980. The most captivating and intimate images in the show were shot while Baltrop was in the Navy. These are dated between 1969 and 1972 and had an unmistakably erotic atmosphere. In his photograph called Three Navy Sailors, a trio of young black men in uniform tease the camera. The man to the far right slyly smiles and sticks his tongue out while the man next to him throws a side glance. The third man to the far left is seen suppressing a laugh. Many of Baltrop's pictures from the pier use distance to enhance his voyeuristic approach. In Don't let them see you, published in his book called The Piers, Baltrop had positioned his camera inside a darkened area looking out at the shadowy foreground and a male figure looking down at another, who is crouched beneath him and performing a sexual act. Neither one of them acknowledges the presence of the nearby photographer and, by extension, the viewer. In another image, Man looking in a window, we see a man wearing a shirt and nothing from the waist down, except his boots, peering into a building through broken windowpanes. This act of voyeurism parallels the photographer's intention when taking this image.\n\nIn 2015, the Spanish publisher TF Editores published Alvin Baltrop: The Piers, edited by James Reid, Tom Watt, and Glenn O'Brien.\n\nFiona Anderson's Cruising the Dead River: David Wojnarowicz and New York's Ruined Waterfront (2019) includes extensive analysis of Baltrop's photography in and among the piers.\n\nThe Bronx Museum held a retrospective of his work in 2019 The Life and Times of Alvin Baltrop. Items from his personal archive (owned by the Bronx Museum) were shown to the public for the first time in this exhibit.\n\nPersonal life\n\nAccording to one journalist, Baltrop came out as gay at fourteen years old.

    "title": "Bennifer",
    "clean_text": "Bennifer and Bennifer 2.0 are the names given by the media to the high-profile relationship between American actor and filmmaker Ben Affleck and American singer Jennifer Lopez. The pair had a widely publicized 18-month romance from 2002 to 2004, and were engaged to be married. After their breakup, they maintained a friendship. They rekindled their romantic relationship in early 2021 and got married in July 2022. However, Lopez filed for divorce after only two years, on August 20, 2024. They have starred in two films together, Gigli (2003) and Jersey Girl (2004), and appeared in two music videos together, \"Jenny from the Block\" (2002) and \"Marry Me\" (ballad version) (2022).\n\nInitial relationship\n Early stages \n\nAlthough they had crossed paths several times before (most notably at the 70th Academy Awards and at the premiere of Armageddon, both in 1998), the first major meeting of Affleck and Lopez took place in late 2001 on the set of their film Gigli while Lopez was still married to Cris Judd. It was rumored by the tabloids that the pair had started an affair due to their friendly and flirty ways, but they both denied these claims, stating that they were just friends. After wrapping filming for the movie in March 2002, Affleck had spent a reported $18,000 on a set of half-page advertisements to express the pleasure he had working with Lopez. He had defended his reasoning for doing so, citing that he had been ashamed of his \"preconceived notions\" of Lopez. Later that April, it was reported that Affleck and Lopez were \"cozying up\" during the opening of her restaurant Madre's. Lopez and Judd separated that summer and Lopez entered a relationship with Affleck. They were photographed together in July 2002.\n\n Engagement and romance \nLopez and Affleck's relationship garnered the first couple portmanteau name in Hollywood, \"Bennifer\". Lopez's single \"Jenny From The Block\", which featured Affleck in the music video, brought on even more attention to the couple, with Lopez describing it as a tabloid frenzy. After three months of dating, Affleck proposed to Lopez at his mother's home in October 2002 with a $1.2m 6.1-carat Harry Winston pink diamond ring. Later that month, Affleck and Lopez began filming their second film together, Jersey Girl. Lopez dedicated her 2002 album This Is Me... Then to Affleck, stating that he was \"her life and sole inspiration for every lyric. She included songs such as \"Baby I Love U!\", \"I'm Glad\" and \"Dear Ben\", which were about her romance with Affleck. On July 18, 2003, Lopez and Affleck had their first primetime interview together on Dateline NBC. On August 1, 2003, Lopez and Affleck's box-office bomb film Gigli released, which is considered one of the worst films in history. After this happened, the media started to portray them in a more negative manner. As Jason Bailey in a piece for the Guardian observed: \"it's important to frame this ghastly reception within the atmosphere of the moment. Affleck and Lopez met during the film’s production and quickly became an item – such a public one that, by the time it hit theaters a year later, the “Bennifer” backlash had built up quite a head of steam. They were young, impossibly good-looking, fabulously wealthy, and clearly hot for each other, so it seemed like a good time to knock them down a peg.\" Lopez had described the experience as overwhelming, and she stated that Affleck hated the attention the pair was getting. The following month, the couple postponed their planned September 2003 wedding just days before it was set to take place due to \"excessive media attention\".\n\n Breakup \nThe pair continued dating for four months before deciding to separate. The former couple's second movie, Jersey Girl, premiered two months later in March 2004, garnering another box-office bomb for the pair. Affleck and Lopez remained in contact in the years after their breakup and spoke highly of each other in public. Affleck called out \"sexist and racist\" critics for comments about Lopez, while Lopez cited the constant media attention as one of the main reasons of their breakup.VH1 Behind the Music, 2010 In 2008, Affleck discussed how he felt during his relationship with Lopez, saying that neither of them \"anticipated\" the degree of attention they would receive, saying: \"we fell in love, we were excited and maybe too accessible,\" but pushed back against the \"curious notion\" that he should view the relationship as a mistake, and reflected on the prevailing tabloid culture at the time \"where it's about one person and everybody focuses on them.\" Lopez has seconded Affleck's words, saying that the media coverage destroyed their relationship \"from the inside out\" and that she felt “eviscerated“ by it. In 2014, Lopez expressed that her breakup with Affleck was her \"first real heartbreak,\" and in 2015 she stated she had \"no regrets\" about their relationship. In early 2021, Affleck praised Lopez for her work ethic, great talent, and success.\n\n Aftermath \nSoon after the pair split, Lopez married singer Marc Anthony. Affleck married actress Jennifer Garner in 2005.\n\nLopez and Anthony ended their seven-year marriage in 2011, officially divorcing in 2014, while Affleck and Garner announced their split in 2015, finalizing their divorce in 2018.\n\nRekindled romance \n\nIn May 2021, shortly after Jennifer Lopez’s split from Alex Rodriguez, she and Ben Affleck sparked reunion rumors with a trip to Montana. Over the summer, they were spotted together at family gatherings and vacations. By September, they attended the Met Gala as a couple, making their relationship public once again. Affleck and Lopez were photographed together for the first time since their initial romance on May 11, 2021. On May 24, 2021, Lopez and Affleck were spotted at Lopez's rental home in Miami with Affleck wearing the watch Lopez had given him in her 2002 \"Jenny From The Block\" music video. On June 1, 2021, Affleck and Lopez were photographed holding each other, their first public display of affection in their rekindled romance. On June 14, 2021, photos and videos of Affleck and Lopez kissing were released to the media for the first time in almost two decades, confirming that their romance was back on. Lopez publicly confirmed their rekindled relationship that July, while they were on vacation in France and Italy. On September 10, 2021, the couple had made their red carpet debut for the first time in 18 years for the premiere of Affleck's film The Last Duel during the Venice Film Festival in Italy. Both Affleck and Lopez have spoken of the gift of a second chance with each other since reuniting. For Valentine's Day, Affleck directed and gifted to Lopez, shared through her OntheJLo Email, a remix of her song \"On My Way\". He also made his second cameo appearance in an official Lopez music video: \"Marry Me\" (Ballad Version).\n\nLopez announced on April 8, 2022, that the pair were engaged again, 20 years after the first proposal. The couple married on July 16, 2022, filing their marriage license in Las Vegas. Lopez legally changed her name to Jennifer Affleck and confirmed the marriage the next day. The following month, they held a wedding celebration for family and friends.\n\nIn June 2024, the couple faced intense scrutiny over the state of their marriage when divorce rumors circulated online. In August 2024, Lopez filed for divorce from Affleck on their second wedding anniversary. The divorce was settled around four months later.",

    "clean_text": "thumb|Foliage\nBanksia benthamiana is a species of shrub that is endemic to the Southwest of Western Australia. It has hairy, linear leaves, usually with scattered small teeth along the edges, and spikes of orange flowers.\n\nDescription\nBanksia benthamiana is a shrub that typically grows to a height of  but does not form a lignotuber. Its bark is roughly flaking and grey and the branchlets are densely covered with rust-coloured hairs. The leaves are linear in shape, mostly  long and  wide on a petiole  long. The sides of the leaves usually have small teeth  long and  apart along one half or more. Both surfaces of the leaves are hairy when young. The flowering spike is borne on a short side branch and is  long and about  wide when the flowers open. Each flower has a hairy perianth  long and a glabrous, curved pistil  long. Flowering occurs from late November to January and up to 130 narrow elliptical, smooth, furry follicles  long,  high and wide, develop in each spike.\n\nTaxonomy\nBanksia benthamiana was first formally described in 1964 by Charles Gardner in the Journal of the Royal Society of Western Australia. The original type specimens were collected in January 1940 near Dalwallinu. The specific epithet honours George Bentham (1800–1884), author of Flora Australiensis.\n\nThis banksia has been traditionally considered to be closely related to B. ashbyi, a larger shrub with larger, more deeply lobed leaves, bright orange flowers and wider, more rounded follicles. It is probably related also to B. audax, a much smaller species with pubescent-hirsute perianth. Using morphological cladistics, Kevin Thiele placed it in a group with  B. audax and B. laevigata, based on very small distinctive seedling leaves, and linear pollen presenters. This grouping was supported in Mast and Givnish's 2002 molecular study. The position of Banksia ashbyi was unclear in this latter study but it did not appear to be closely related.\n\nDistribution and habitat\nThis banksia is found in scattered populations between Mullewa and Kulja in the Southwest of Western Australia. It grows on plains in shrubland, sometimes as an emergent plant, on brownish yellow sandy loam or clay-loam, sometimes over laterite. Many of the populations are small and on road verges. The annual rainfall in these areas is around .\n\nConservation status\nBanksia benthamiana is currently classified as \"Priority Four\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife, meaning that is rare or near threatened.\n\nEcology\nVolunteers for the 1985 Banksia Atlas reported that moths and birds have been seen pollinating it.\n\nUse in horticulture\nBanksia benthamiana is almost unknown in cultivation and unsuitable for small gardens, but can be grown in a container and is fast growing. A slightly acid deep sand or gravel soil is desirable. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 19 to 42 days to germinate.",

    "title": "Baron Hirsch Synagogue",
    "clean_text": "The Baron Hirsch Synagogue (also Baron Hirsch Congregation), is a Modern Orthodox Jewish congregation and synagogue located at 400 South Yates Road, Memphis, Tennessee, in the United States. Founded in , the congregation underwent tremendous growth in the first half of the 20th century, emerging, in the 1950s, as the largest Orthodox congregation in North America, a position it still holds.\n\nIts former building, located at 1740 Vollintine Avenue, is an impressive International Style structure built in the 1950s. The building is a U.S. Historic District Contributing Property and the centerpiece of the Vollintine Hills Historic District, a cohesive collection of 78 post-World War II Minimal Traditional and ranch-style houses built around the former synagogue by members of the congregation. State of Tennessee, Environment and Conservation Newsroom News Release, September 21, 2007.  Accessed 2008-08-22.\n\nHistory\n\n1860s–1910\nThe nucleus of the Jewish community in Memphis formed in the downtown area north of Adams Street commonly known as the \"Pinch\" or \"Pinch District\".  The Pinch was the center of, and traditionally associated with, immigration and immigrant communities in Memphis.\n\nHaving no permanent place of worship at its initial organization in the 1860s, around 1884, a group of Jewish immigrants who wished to follow religious Orthodoxy began to pray together in rooms above various downtown Memphis stores, at private homes, and on the second floor of a modest hotel.   Rabbi I. Myerowitz was the congregation's first spiritual leader, serving from 1891 to 1893.\n\nIn about 1890 or 1892, the group was chartered as the Baron Hirsch Benevolent Society, named in honor of the famed French Jewish philanthropist, Baron Moritz de Hirsch.  \"The Three Barons\", The Jerusalem Post, January 13, 2006. \"Perhaps Baron Hirsch’s most lasting memorial in the world to his efforts to solve the “Jewish problem” in Europe is the magnificent large synagogue and community of the Baron Hirsch Congregation in Memphis, Tennessee. It is one of the largest Orthodox synagogues and communities in the United States.\"\n\nThat same year they purchased a former African American church at 4th Street and Washington Avenue, in the Pinch, for use as a synagogue, moving in 1912. A contemporary account gives membership in 1904 as eighty-five.\n\n1910–1920s\n\nThe Baron Hirsch congregation continued to grow and soon tore down their old building and built a new synagogue, at a cost of $35,000 ($ in current dollar terms), on the same site in 1915.  The new synagogue's sanctuary could hold over 700 worshippers. Still located in the downtown Pinch district, the congregation built the Menorah Institute next to the synagogue in 1928, providing classrooms and space for the congregation's social activities.  This building was razed after the congregation relocated in the 1950s.Shankman, Sam (1957). Baron Hirsch Congregation: From Ur to Memphis.  Memphis, Tennessee: Baron Hirsch Synagogue, p. 18. Cited in \nNational Register of Historic Places Registration Form: Vollintine Hills Historic District, Memphis, TN. January 2, 2007, Section 8, page 16.\n\nThe total Jewish population in Memphis in 1920 was approximately 7,000 persons.\n\n1930s–1940s\nIn the 1930s, the Memphis Jewish community continued the move eastward from the Pinch and other downtown neighborhoods that had begun in the 1920s to the new subdivisions in northern Midtown around the Vollintine-Evergreen area and many members began keeping Sabbath apartments downtown in order to attend synagogue.  The congregation struggled somewhat in the Depression years. However, by 1941, Baron Hirsch had 500 member households and 300 children in its religious school.\n\nDuring World War II, it opened the Menorah Institute to soldiers stationed in the area, converting part of the building to a USO Center with sleeping quarters.  The outside area between the synagogue and the Menorah Institute was paved for use in USO dances.\n\n1950s\n\nthumb|right|South portico and entrance facing Vollintine Avenue\n\nFlourishing in the post-War years under the leadership of Rabbi Isadore Goodman, by the late 1950s, it had grown to over 1000 households and 500 children in its school.  This dramatic increase in membership coupled with the movement of Jews out of the downtown Pinch area, spurred the congregation to begin planning  for a new synagogue.\n\nBuilt in two phases — 1950–52 and 1955–57 — on a  plot, the enormous new synagogue rose on the site of a former golf course at Vollintine Avenue and Evergreen Street in midtown Memphis (in what is now the Vollintine Hills Historic District). It was built with 2200 permanent seats in the sanctuary and accommodation for an additional 1000 worshippers. When it was completed in 1957, the main sanctuary of the synagogue was the largest in the United States, according to the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America.“Orthodox Synagogue to Be Dedicated November 28–30.” Memphis Commercial Appeal, October 21, 1957.\n\nThe $1,600,000 rectilinear International Style building was designed by architect George Awsumb with powerful gray limestone wall cladding enhancing its clean modern lines.  Artisan Jack Grue designed the stained glass windows.\n\nConstruction of this new synagogue, along with a significant amount of new housing for members of the congregation that was within walking distance of the synagogue, created a clearly definable geographic area, readily distinguishable from other areas, which has now been placed on the National Register of Historic Places and called the Vollintine Hills Historic District.\n \nThe congregation's membership doubled in the new synagogue, emerging as the largest Orthodox congregation in the United States. Explanations for this strong growth vary: A claim has been made that it is a \"testament to the strength of orthodox Judaism in Memphis;\" other sources attribute it as something of a hallmark or local trait, that is, the tendency at that time for both Jews and Christians in Memphis to be affiliated with a religious institution.   In the United States in the 1950s, there was a national trend towards increased affiliation with both church and synagogue membership rising in an unprecedented fashion.  The country experienced a 40% rise in population from the 1930s to the 1950s but a 50% increase in church and synagogue affiliation.Yearbook of American Churches, 1950, quoted in Hebrew Watchman, September 19, 1957, and cited in Lewis, A Biblical People in the Bible Belt: The Jewish Community of Memphis, Tennessee, 1840s–1960s, p. 179.\n\nRecent changes\nContinual neighborhood transitions and the ongoing movement of members toward the east-lying Memphis suburbs, meant that the congregation again needed to find an additional location to remain within walking distance of most of its members.  Under the leadership of the late Rabbi Rafael G. Grossman the congregation began a transition from its edifice in midtown Memphis.\n\nBaron Hirsch acquired the estate of musician Isaac Hayes and converted the mansion for its use as a satellite campus.  By the mid-1980s, almost all Baron Hirsch members were in this area and it was determined that the entire synagogue complex would have to move as well. Additional land was purchased next to the satellite site, another building campaign was undertaken, and the large new synagogue and campus on South Yates Road was completed in 1988.\n\nCurrent status\nAlthough it has declined somewhat from its post-World War II peak, Baron Hirsch continues to flourish as a Modern Orthodox Zionist congregation.\n\nThe congregation is currently led by Senior Rabbi Ian Lichter, and the weekly services are led by Cantor Ricky Kampf.\n\nThe Baron Hirsch Synagogue continues to add to the community around it. In recent years it added a large outdoor space, the Mendelson Park and Playground. The synagogue also undertook a large building campaign to improve its facilities which was completed in 2022, and constructed the new Memphis Mikvah at Baron Hirsch, also completed in 2022.",

He was educated at New College School in Oxford, and then obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree as a member of St Catherine's Society, Oxford (a non-collegiate body that later became St Catherine's College). He held various posts at the Bodleian Library: Assistant (1895–1912); Secretary to Bodley's Librarian (1912–1931); and Sub-Librarian (1931–1945). He became a lecturer in bibliography in the university's Faculty of English in 1923, and was honorary secretary and general editor of the Oxford Bibliographical Society (of which he was a co-founder) from 1922 onwards. He was appointed Keeper of the Archives of the university in June 1927. He retired from his various posts in 1945. \n\nHis main area of study was book binding, becoming \"a master in that field\" in the words of The Times. His main work, written with John Johnson (Printer to the University of Oxford), was Print and Privilege at Oxford to the year 1700, which drew on his knowledge of bibliography and university history. His publications included works on book binding, Oxford libraries, an edition of the ancient statutes of the university, and Oxford's ceremonies; he was also contributor to the Victoria County History volume on the university. He was awarded the Gold Medal of the Bibliographical Society in 1947 in recognition of his work as a bibliographer. He died at his home in Oxford on 18 February 1958.\n\nFamily\nIn 1908, Gibson married Margaret Alice Clinkard (1884-1973).

    "title": "Peter and the Wolf (TV special)",
    "clean_text": "Peter and the Wolf is a 1995 live-action/animated television special based on the 1936 musical composition/fairy tale of the same name by Sergei Prokofiev, and directed by American conductor George Daugherty. It first aired Friday, December 8, 1995, on ABC in the United States. The music for this special was performed by the RCA Victor Symphony Orchestra conducted by Daugherty.\n\nThe main characters that appear in the animated sequences that intervene the live-action ones, are designed by cartoonist Chuck Jones, who also serves as the special's executive consultant.\n\nPlot\nAnnie and her son, Peter, get a very warm welcome by his grandfather, also named Peter, as they arrive at his house. Later, in the dining room, Annie and Peter discuss their hectic daily routine in Los Angeles with the grandfather. As the conversation goes on, he realizes how little time Peter and his mother spend together, and considers \"rectifying\" things. It ends with Annie explaining to him how the city can become a scary place. Next, she opens the window and talks to Peter about how the meadow outside used to be her playground, and the \"friends\" she had with there. The grandfather recollects an event that happened once in that meadow, which Annie starts narrating to Peter.\n\nOn the first day of Spring, Peter goes into the meadow to visit his friend, the bird, leaving the garden gate open. The bird is incubating six eggs. While they play together, the duck that lives in the yard takes the opportunity and also goes out, as it's been a long winter for him and he wants to have a \"real swim\". As the duck starts swimming in a pond nearby, he argues with the bird (\"What kind of bird are you if you can't fly?\" – \"What kind of bird are you if you can't swim?\"). Peter's pet cat stalks them quietly, and the bird—warned by Peter—flies away. The cat then aims for the duck, but doesn't manage to catch it either. Peter's grandfather scolds him for being outside in the meadow alone (\"What if a wolf came out of the forest all of a sudden?\"), and takes him back into the house.\n\nIn response to Peter's comment (\"But what could happen anyway, with a cat, a duck and stupid little bird?\"), Annie continues narrating the story. Soon afterwards \"a big, grey wolf\" does indeed come out of the forest. The cat quickly climbs into a tree, but the duck, who is in the pond, is overtaken, and swallowed by the wolf.\n\nPeter fetches a rope and climbs over the garden wall, so he can go outside and climb the tree. He asks the bird to fly around the wolf's head to distract him. The wolf gets exhausted, and Peter slowly lowers a noose and catches the wolf by his tail. The wolf struggles to get free, but Peter ties the rope to the tree and the noose only gets tighter.\n\nSome hunters, who have been tracking the wolf, come out of the forest ready to shoot. The wolf gets scared, and pops the swallowed duck alive, out of his mouth. He starts dancing as the wolf is being captured. The hunters are about to shoot either one of the two, but Peter tells not to shoot either of them. Shortly after, the wolf, described as \"not a ballet fan\", grabs the duck again before being forced to drop him by the hunters. Peter gets them to create a cage for the wolf and help him take it to a zoo. What follows is a victory parade, that includes himself, the bird, the hunters leading the wolf, the cat, and his Grandfather, who in this version, ends up congratulating Peter. The female bird's eggs also hatch.\n\nAs the story ends, Peter finds the duck crouching at the pond's edge, shivering and frightened because of his terrible experience, and Peter reassures it that he will always be there to protect him.\n\nPeter starts doubting that the story actually happened. His grandfather shows him the clothes he was wearing that day. Peter then gets excited, and starts wearing them. The special ends with Peter going outside in the meadow (in a mixture of live-action with animation), where he also finds the cat, the duck, and the bird from the story.\n\nCast and characters\n\nKirstie Alley as Annie: Peter's mother in the live-action segments. She is described as conservative at the beginning of the special, as to Peter's life alongside her in Los Angeles. During the special, it's revealed that in the meadow outside the house, she was playing with the animals, which were the only friends of her, and she narrates the story that unfolds during the animated segments.\nShe also voices the following animals in the animated sequences: a bird that's \"heroic,\" a cat that's \"playful and a bit of a coward,\" and a duck.\nRoss Malinger as Peter: Annie's son. In this special, he visits alongside her mother, his same-named Grandfather, who tries to \"rectify\" things by prompting him to do stuff he can't in Los Angeles, and thus, \"discover what life is all about.\"\nLloyd Bridges as Grandfather: Peter's same-named grandfather. In the special, he tries to make Peter \"feel free to explore all the wonderful things around him,\" and starts recalling in the beginning of the special, the adventure he embarked on when he was a little boy. He married with his wife in the meadow.\nHe also voices Peter's grandfather in the animated sequences.\nGeorge Daugherty voices the \"ominous\" wolf.\nDavid Ka Lik Wong voices the hunters.\n\nProduction\nThe initial development of the special can be traced back in 1992, when Chuck Jones and George Daugherty (who conducted Bugs Bunny on Broadway and composed several 90s Looney Tunes shorts) formed Impossible Productions, a studio based in Los Angeles, to create a special based on the Peter and the Wolf composition.\n\nThe final special was produced in association with Chuck Jones Enterprises, responsible for animation development and pre-production, and ITEL. IF/X Productions was responsible for the live-action and special effects production unit. The animation was produced at Cosgrove Hall Films. Daugherty said that \"... we wanted to find an animation company that could take Chuck's brilliant characters and realize them in a way that, was in keeping with the traditions that he had established over the course of his sixty-year career.\" Jean Flynn, the animation director, noted how the special would be mostly \"based on music,\" in contrast with other animated films at the time, which made the animation production, in order to comply with the composition's pacing, a difficult process. In response to the animation being outsourced, Jones said:\n\nMusic\nSoundtrack\n\nA soundtrack album was released by RCA Red Seal Records in 1996. It was re-released by Sony Masterworks. In Canada, it was released in May 1997.\n\nTrack listing\nTracks 1-16 are used from the animated segments and have Kirstie Alley's narration. Tracks 17-31 are performances of the music without narration, and the rest is used from the live-action ones, without dialogue.\n\nRelease\nThe special was released on March 19, 1996, on VHS, by Malofilm Video and BMG Video. It also had a \"special edition\" release on LaserDisc by Image Entertainment in 1997. The LaserDisc release also includes concept art and animatic and storyboard segments, and interviews with Chuck Jones, George Daughterty and the main cast of the film. In November 2003, it was released on DVD (regions 1, 2 and 5), VHS (NTSC) and VCD (distributed by Alliance Entertainment Singapore Pte. Ltd.) by Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment. The DVD features an educational match game about animals and instruments that isn't related to the special. The latter release was praised by reviewers who recommended it for young children. In Australia, the film was released on VHS by 21st Century Pictures in 1996, and Columbia TriStar in 2004.\n\nBeyond the Meadow, a documentary on the making of the film, directed by Casey Bridges, and The Music of Peter and the Wolf, an educational short about the symphony orchestra hosted by Julia Glander,Credits of The Music of Peter and the Wolf featurette are featured in both the LaserDisc and DVD releases.\n\nIn Norway, the film was released on VHS, by Svensk Filmindustri, with the dub starring Tor Stokke, Minken Fosheim and Nils-Martin Crawfurd. The version of the special in this release differs from the 2003 Columbia TriStar one, in terms of the opening BMG logo, in which the \"Video\" subtext is absent, as well as the smaller size of the letters in the opening and ending credits, and \"The End\" text.\n\nReception\nRatings\nBased on a 13.2/37 rating/share according to Nielsen, among 2-to-11-year-old children, Peter and the Wolf was the first primetime program with children for the week of December 4, 1995.\n\nCritical reception\nJonathan Storm of The Philadelphia Inquirer was positive in his review, calling the production \"one of the best children's shows in years.\" He particularly praised the animal characters and Alley's narration. Lynne Heffley of Los Angeles Times regarded it as \"a refreshing break for a good amount of children's entertainment that's heavy on attitude.\" The special also received noteworthy praise by Kirk Nicewonger of United Features Syndicate, The San Francisco Examiner, The Hollywood Reporter, The Louisville Courier Journal, Chicago Tribune, The Harrisburg Patriot, The Indianapolis Star and Vårt Land.\n\nScott Blakey in another review by Chicago Tribune called the special \"a missed opportunity,\" as well as too \"cute and overdone\" for the most part. He referred to the script as \"bloated\" and criticized Alley's narration. It was also noted that the animation was outsourced to another company, instead of being done by Chuck Jones himself.\n\nAward and nominations\nThe special received a 1996 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Children's Program and received a second Emmy nomination for Daugherty, for Outstanding Music Direction. Daugherty (also one of the writers) and Janis Diamond received a Writers Guild of America Award nomination for the script. The production received a Gold Hugo and Silver Hugo at Chicago International Film Festival. It also received a Parents' Choice award, an Award of Excellence from the Film Advisory Board and a WorldFest-Houston grand award for best television production. It's also approved by Kids First and The Dove Foundation.\n\nMerchandise\nA year prior the special's release, Time Warner would publish a series of merchandising developed by IF/X Interactive, entitled Chuck Jones' Peter and the Wolf, utilizing the animated sequences of the special. An interactive CD-ROM was published by Time Warner Interactive for Windows 3.1 and Macintosh computers with System 7 or higher,Back cover of CD-ROM release featuring a \"log jam game,\" concept art, educational media about the symphony orchestra and the musical instruments (such as video performances by students from the Colburn School of the Performing Arts, also included in The Music of Peter and the Wolf featurette), and screen documentaries of Chuck Jones and Sergei Prokofiev. The animated sequences differ from the ones in the special, as the narration done by Kirstie Alley differs, and the character design for Peter resembles more the one found in initial concept arts for the special. The music was performed by the Time Warner Symphony Orchestra. In the CD-ROM's package, there was an additional CD featuring a version with the narration and music alone, and another one with just the music. Reviews of the CD-ROM were generally favorable. Ty Burr of Entertainment Weekly praised the Chuck Jones animation and the educational orchestra section, but criticized the technical limitations of the disc, which resulted in \"jerky movement and overly long pauses,\" and questioned the existence of the log jam game.A deluxe hardcover book was released by Warner Books, and a read-along book and audio cassette by TW Kids, a division of Atlantic Records and Time Warner.Ending credits",

    "title": "Gordon Bennett (general)",
    "clean_text": "Lieutenant General Henry Gordon Bennett,  (15 April 1887 – 1 August 1962) was a senior Australian Army officer who served in both World War I and World War II. \n\nDespite highly decorated achievements during World War I, during which he commanded at both battalion and brigade level and became the youngest general in the Australian Army, Bennett is best known for his role in the Fall of Singapore in February 1942. As commander of the 8th Australian Division, he chose to escape to Sumatra after the British-led garrison surrendered to the Japanese. His soldiers became prisoners of war of the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA). Bennett claimed he left in order to avoid capture and report directly to Australian authorities, believing he could better serve the war effort from outside captivity. \n\nHis decision was met with widespread criticism. Many viewed his departure as a breach of military responsibility and abandonment of his men. In 1945, both a Royal Commission and a military inquiry were held to examine his actions. They found that he was not justified in relinquishing his command. Although he was later given a corps-level post in Australia, he never again held a field command or led troops in battle. The controversy surrounding his escape remained a defining aspect of his legacy.\n\nA citizen soldier, before World War I Bennett had worked in the insurance industry and at the conclusion of hostilities pursued his commercial interests while continuing to serve in the military in a part-time capacity, commanding at brigade and divisional level. He retired from the Army after World War II and turned to farming in the Hills District northwest of Sydney. He remained active in the world of business and as a military commentator, before dying in 1962 at the age of 75\n\nEarly life\nBennett (who was always known as Gordon) was born in Balwyn, Melbourne, on 15 April 1887, to George Bennett, a South African-born school teacher, and his Australian-born wife, Harriet. He was the sixth of nine children and attended Balwyn State School, where his father taught, and then Hawthorn College as a teenager having been given a three-year scholarship. While at Hawthorn, he did well at mathematics and in 1903, as a 16-year-old, after completing a competitive examination he was accepted into the AMP Society to train as an actuary. In May 1908, just after he turned 21, Bennett volunteered to serve in the Militia, Australia's reserve military force, joining the 5th Australian Infantry Regiment as a \"recruit officer\". After completing a six-month part-time course, he was appointed as a provisional second lieutenant, and posted to the regiment's 'B' Company, in Carlton, Victoria. He continued to work at AMP during this time, but devoted most of his spare time to his military duties and rose in rank quickly, reaching major in 1912, at the age of 25, when he became adjutant of his regiment.\n\nAt the outbreak of World War I in 1914, Bennett volunteered to serve with the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) and, after securing his release from AMP on full pay, was appointed second-in-command of the 6th Battalion, which was part of the 2nd (Victorian) Infantry Brigade, assigned to the 1st Division. After a short period of training, the 1st Division began to embark for Europe. Just prior to his departure overseas, Bennett became engaged to Bess Agnes Buchanan, whom he had met at a dance in Canterbury. As an engagement gift, Bess bought her betrothed a miniature photo of herself, set in a gold frame. Bennett carried the picture in his jacket pocket while serving overseas and it later saved his life on the Western Front, deflecting a German bullet.\n\nGallipoli\nWhile in transit, as a result of overcrowding in training camps in the United Kingdom, the 1st Division was diverted to Egypt with the intention that it would complete its training there before moving to the Western Front at a later date. The decision by the Allies to force a passage through the Dardanelles interrupted this process, as the 1st Division was allocated to take part in the Gallipoli Campaign. During the landing at Anzac Cove on 25 April 1915, Bennett fought on the southern flank of the Anzac beachhead. He led 300 men of his battalion to an advanced position on Pine Ridge, south of Lone Pine. While directing the defence of this position, Bennett was wounded in the shoulder and wrist and forced to retire to the beach for treatment. When the Turkish forces counter-attacked in the evening, the 6th Battalion force on Pine Ridge was isolated and killed to the last man, including Bennett's younger brother, Godfrey. Instead of accepting evacuation on a hospital ship, after having his wounds treated, Bennett returned to his battalion.\n\nIn early May, the 2nd Brigade was selected to move to Cape Helles to reinforce the British forces for the Second Battle of Krithia. After being transferred by boat, on 8 May, Bennett advanced with his battalion in impossible conditions. Bennett was the only officer of the 6th, and one of few in the 2nd Brigade, to survive the advance unscathed, although he was lucky do so; as he led the charge, a Turkish bullet hit the ammunition pouch he wore, exploding the ammunition in it. He was knocked off his feet, but otherwise unharmed. With a handful of men, he achieved the furthest advance of the attack.  He became commander of the 6th Battalion the next day. The battalion was then returned to Anzac by a trawler, and shortly afterwards, Bennett's command of the battalion was confirmed and he was promoted to lieutenant colonel.\n\nThroughout June and July, Bennett's battalion occupied the front line during a period of reduced tempo fighting as a stalemate developed. On 7 August, when the Allies launched their August Offensive to break the stalemate, the 6th Battalion was involved in one of the supporting attacks at the start of the Battle of Sari Bair. While the best known attack was made by the 3rd Light Horse Brigade at the Nek, the 6th was required to make a similar attack against a neighbouring Turkish position known as German Officers' Trench from which machine guns enfiladed the Australian positions as far north as the Nek. Two attempts to capture the trench failed. A third attempt was organised and Bennett resolved to lead it himself but the commander of the 1st Division, Major General Harold Walker, after consulting with the corps commander, Lieutenant General William Birdwood, agreed to abandon the attack. The 6th Battalion's losses totalled 80 killed and 66 wounded.\n\nFollowing the attack on the German Officers' Trench, Bennett's battalion was withdrawn from the front line briefly, before relieving the 1st Brigade, which had successfully captured Lone Pine. The August Offensive failed and a further lull in the fighting occurred. The following month, as reinforcements in the shape of the 2nd Division arrived at Anzac, the original Australian units were relieved on a rotational basis, including the 6th Battalion, which was sent back to Lemnos. While there, Bennett was hospitalised with paratyphoid and during his stay in hospital, he received word that he had been appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG). When the 6th Battalion was returned to Gallipoli, Bennett sought to return with them, but was ordered to sail to England aboard the transport Aquitania for further treatment. As well as his CMG, Bennett was also mentioned in despatches twice for his service at Gallipoli.\n\nWestern Front\nthumb|Bennett and his headquarters staff near the Menin Road, Belgium, 20 October 1917\nBennett spent Christmas in Southampton, before returning to Egypt early in January 1916. There, he rejoined his battalion, which was stationed around Gebel Habeita, defending the Suez Canal. He arrived just as the AIF began a period of reorganisation and expansion, which saw the experienced units of the 1st Division being split to provide cadres to the newly formed 5th Division; as a part of this, the 6th Battalion was split to help form the 58th Battalion in late February.\n\nIn March 1916, the 1st Division moved to France as part of the transfer of the AIF's infantry formations to the Western Front. Bennett subsequently led the 6th Battalion through the Battle of Pozières. After the 1st and 3rd Brigades had captured the town on 24 July 1916, the 6th and 8th Battalions of the 2nd Brigade moved in to occupy the ruins where they had to endure a prolonged artillery bombardment. Bennett's battalion headquarters was in a log hut. The hut received six direct hits from shells but survived due to the debris that had accumulated around it. Shortly after Bennett relocated his HQ the hut was finally demolished. On 26 July Bennett protested at the conditions his men had to endure, reporting: \"My men are being unmercifully shelled. They cannot hold out if an attack is launched. The firing line and my headquarters are being plastered with heavy guns and the town is being swept by shrapnel. I myself am O.K. but the front line is being buried.\" In the capture of Pozières, Bennett's 6th Battalion suffered 190 casualties, the least by a considerable margin of the 12 battalions in the 1st Division.\n\nAfter this, Bennett continued to serve as the commanding officer of the 6th Battalion, as well as acting as the 3rd Brigade commander. In mid-November, Bennett took a brief leave in London, where he was reunited with his fiancée, Bess, who had sailed from Melbourne with her father to meet him. On 16 November, they were married in Chelsea, and after a short honeymoon in Scotland, Bennett returned to the front. On 3 December 1916, he was given command of the 3rd Infantry Brigade and promoted to brigadier general, becoming at 29 the youngest general in the Australian Army. He commanded the brigade for the remainder of the war on the Western Front, leading the brigade through several notable actions, including at Bullecourt, Menin Road, and Passchendaele during 1917, and several actions against the Hindenburg Line in 1918. While Bennett was serving at the front, his wife remained in England; he returned to her briefly in November 1917 and again in July 1918. Just after the war ended, Bess returned to Australia with the couple's 10-month-old daughter, while Bennett remained in Europe until June 1919, briefly touring the Rhine and then viewing the London victory parade, where he escorted Lady Birdwood while her husband, Lord Birdwood, the former commander of the Australian Corps, marched.\n\nFor his service on the Western Front, Bennett received many awards. He received the Order of Danilo from Montenegro in 1917, was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1918, received a Distinguished Service Order in 1919 and mentioned in despatches a further six times. His attitude towards regular officers and temperament, as well as his tendency to act without clearing his actions with superiors, though, resulted in criticism from senior officers.\n\nBetween the wars\nUpon his return to Australia, Bennett lived at Canterbury with his wife and daughter, while he sought to return to civilian life after his appointment to the AIF was terminated. He was offered his old position at AMP back, having been on full-time leave with pay while serving overseas, but was unhappy with this. He was eventually offered a position in the Commonwealth Bank in Sydney and he moved there with his family. Later, he purchased a textile factory and worked as a clothing manufacturer and public accountant before being appointed chairman of the New South Wales Repatriation Board in 1922, in which role he was able to help returned soldiers. In 1928, he was appointed as an administrator of the City of Sydney, along with two other commissioners. He was president of the Chamber of Manufactures of New South Wales between 1931 and 1933 and the Associated Chambers of Manufactures of Australia between 1933 and 1934, and was involved in several conservative political groups such as the All for Australia League and the Defence of Australia League.\n\nBennett remained active in the military, continuing to serve as part of the Militia, which was reorganised in 1921 following the conclusion of the demobilisation process. From then until 1926, he served as commander of the 9th Infantry Brigade, before being appointed to command the 2nd Division. In 1930, he was promoted to the rank of major general and over the ensuing years became increasingly parochial against the small permanent Staff Corps. He was transferred to the unattached list in 1932. In 1937, amidst increasing tensions in Europe, he came into conflict with the Military Board after he wrote a number of newspaper articles expressing his concerns about complacent defence policy and the efficiency of regular officers.\n\nWorld War II\nthumb|Bennett, briefing war correspondents in Malaya, January 1942\n\nWhen World War II broke out in September 1939, although only 52, Bennett was passed over for command of the Second Australian Imperial Force, the position going to General Thomas Blamey. The Chief of the General Staff, General Sir Brudenell White, seems to have been opposed to Bennett being given an active command. In the Australian Dictionary of Biography (ADB), A. B. Lodge, Bennett's biographer, commented: \"Because of his temperament, he was considered unsuitable for a semi-diplomatic command, and one that involved subordination to British generals. Bennett was as scathing of British officers as he was of Australian regulars.\"\n\nInstead, Bennett was given a command in the Volunteer Defence Corps, the Australian version of the British Home Guard. In July 1940, he took over command of the Eastern Command Training Depot. After White's death in the Canberra air disaster in August 1940, Bennett was appointed commander of the newly formed 8th Division, replacing Vernon Sturdee, who was promoted to White's former role.\n\nIn February 1941, the 8th Division's headquarters, along with one of its brigades – the 22nd – was posted to Malaya after a request from the British for Australia to contribute troops to bolster the garrison there, amid growing concerns of war with the Japanese, and as part of the plans that had been formulated as the pre-war Singapore strategy. The 27th Brigade was also dispatched in August, but the division's third brigade, the 23rd Brigade remained in Australia. Relations between Bennett and his superiors, and also his subordinate brigade commander, Brigadier Harold Taylor, were not good. Lodge commented: \"Bennett's dealings with British senior officers, especially with the general officer commanding, Malaya, Lieutenant General A.E. Percival, were devoid of harmony.\"\n\nthumb|left|upright=1.3|alt=Four men in summer military uniforms in front of a map of northern Australia |Air Commodore Raymond Brownell (second right), Lieutenant-General Bennett (far right) and Allied naval officers discussing an SWPA situation map, February 1943\n\nIn December 1941, the Japanese invasion of Malaya began. Bennett found himself in command of an ad hoc force known as \"Westforce\", which included the Australian 27th Brigade – but not the 22nd, which had been transferred to III Indian Corps – and several Indian units. Bennett's command was not engaged in the early stages of the fighting because the initial Japanese attacks fell on British and Indian units around Kota Bharu and the Thai–Malay border. However, as the Japanese pushed the defenders back and advanced into Johore, the Australians fought several actions throughout January. The most significant of those came around Gemas and Muar, in which the Australians experienced some local success before being forced to withdraw to Singapore at the end of the month, along with the rest of the Allied forces.\n\nOn Singapore, Bennett's command once again included the two Australian brigades – the 22nd and 27th – which were allocated the task of defending the north-western sector of the island. On 8 February 1942, the Japanese launched an assault across the Johore Strait, concentrating upon the sector held by Bennett's troops. The weight fell on the 22nd Brigade's area and, trying to fend off two Japanese divisions, they were eventually forced to withdraw towards the centre of the island. The 27th Brigade initially managed to hold its sector, but it was subjected to a follow-up assault on 10 February and, as the 22nd fell back, it was also forced to withdraw. Heavy fighting followed over the next week, but eventually the Allied troops were pushed across the island to Singapore's urban areas.\n\nOn 15 February, Percival began surrender negotiations with the Japanese. That night, Bennett decided that it was his duty to escape from Singapore rather than surrender. Consequently, he handed over command of the 8th Division to Brigadier Cecil Callaghan and, with a few junior officers and some local Europeans, Bennett commandeered a sampan and crossed the Strait of Malacca to the east coast of Sumatra. There, they transferred to a launch in which they sailed up the Batang Hari River, eventually proceeding by car to Padang, on the west coast of Sumatra. From there, Bennett flew to Java and then to Australia, arriving in Melbourne on 2 March 1942.\n\nThe fall of Singapore – the largest capitulation in British military history – shocked Australians, resulting in the capture of almost 15,000 Australians and many more Indian and British soldiers. Nevertheless, Bennett's escape was initially regarded as praiseworthy, at least publicly. Prime Minister John Curtin issued a statement that read:\n\nHowever, within the military, particularly its senior echelons, Bennett was criticised for leaving his troops. In April 1942, he was promoted to lieutenant general and given command of III Corps in Perth. At the time, it was an important post but, by 1943, as the possibility of a Japanese invasion of Australia faded, it became a backwater. Bennett was told by Blamey that he would not be given another active command, and Bennett was transferred to the Reserve of Officers in May 1944. He soon published his account of the Malayan campaign, Why Singapore Fell, which was critical of Percival and other British officers, although his opinions were later challenged by several Australian officers, including Callaghan. Blamey unsuccessfully tried to prevent the book's publication.\n\nUpon retirement from active service, Bennett began writing for a Sydney newspaper and was a correspondent for the Australian Broadcasting Commission. He remained concerned about his soldiers, though, and met the first group of recently freed 8th Division prisoners of war when they arrived in Sydney on the transport Manunda. For their part, the majority of his former soldiers welcomed him, and some even hung a sign over the side of the ship, which read: \"We want Bennett\". They later put it in his car as a gesture of their support.\n\nPostwar inquiries\nThe controversy over Bennett's actions became public in mid-1945, when the war ended and Percival and Callaghan were released from Japanese captivity. Percival, who had never got on with Bennett, wrote a letter accusing him of relinquishing his command without permission. Callaghan delivered the letter to Blamey upon his release and Blamey convened a court of enquiry under Lieutenant General Leslie Morshead, and Major Generals Victor Stantke and George Wootten, which found that Bennett was not justified in handing over his command, or in leaving Singapore. Veterans of the 8th Division, who were generally loyal to Bennett, protested against this finding.\n\nIn November 1945, Prime Minister Ben Chifley appointed a Royal Commission under Justice G. C. Ligertwood. The Commission concluded that Bennett had disobeyed Percival's order to surrender. Lodge wrote:\n\nIn 1948, Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Fry, a military lawyer, published the opinion: \"The Royal Commissioner based his report on an interpretation of international law, and did not discuss General Bennett's action from the standpoint of Australian military law, which placed him under no inflexible obligation to remain on Singapore Island.\"\n\nPost military and retirement\nBennett later became an orchardist, purchasing a property and living at Glenorie in the Hills district on Sydney's North Western fringe, until 1955 when, due to deteriorating health following a coronary occlusion, he sold his orchard and moved to Dural, New South Wales. He travelled to Singapore in 1957 with his wife to attend the opening of the Kranji War Memorial and then in 1960, travelled to Japan to meet with officers who had fought in Malaya. He wrote a number of articles on military topics and served on the board of a number of companies. From 1960 to 1962, he was Chairman of Directors of MMI Insurance. He died on 1 August 1962 at Dural, survived by his wife and daughter. After a state funeral at St Andrew's Cathedral, his body was cremated. The diary that Bennett kept while serving in Malaya is held at the State Library of New South Wales.",

His  family fled to Svishtov, where they lived in poverty. He took a job as a clerk in Romania and remained there until Bulgaria was liberated in 1878, returning home determined to be an artist. In 1881, after working as a telegraph operator for two years, he saved enough money to enroll at the Accademia di Belle Arti di Firenze where he studied under the direction of Giuseppe Ciaranfi. Upon his return home, he worked as a journalist and a teacher in Stara Zagora, Plovdiv, Varna and Sofia.\n\nIn 1896, he was one of the co-founders of the National Academy of Arts in Sofia, where he taught art history, drawing and perspective. He served two terms as its director, from 1912 to 1918, and from 1924 to 1927. In 1898, he was part of a team of artists that decorated the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral. One of the first Bulgarian painters to exhibit internationally, he played a decisive role in dispelling the image of his country as a cultural backwater.\n\nHe was also active in the nation's political and cultural life, making contributions to many newspapers such as Balkan Dawn, Evening Post and World as well as the magazine Art (usually under pseudonyms, such as \"Tonino\" and \"Arnold\"). He also lectured extensively and did book illustrations (those for Under the Yoke by Ivan Vazov are, perhaps, best known).\n\nAmong his works are the first seascapes painted in Bulgaria, although he specialized in genre art and portraits. A street in Plovdiv is named after him. His brother Georgi was also a well-known painter.",

    "title": "Hunting Rifle (film)",
    "clean_text": "Hunting Rifle () is a 1961 Japanese drama film directed by Heinosuke Gosho. It is based on the 1949 novella of the same name by Yasushi Inoue.\n\nPlot\nIn a short prologue, a hunter armed with a double-barreled gun, accompanied only by his dog, walks through a snowy landscape, while a narrator describes his appearance. The film then switches to a flashback which takes up the rest of the film.\n\nMisugi, the hunter of the opening sequence, and a company director and art collector, is newly married to the much younger and inexperienced Midori. Midori's older cousin Saiko has been married for a few years to successful physician Kadota. One day, a woman named Hamako shows up with her young child in Saiko's house, claiming that she is Kadota's former mistress and the child his extramarital daughter Shoko. When Hamako dies in an accident shortly after, Saiko agrees to adopt Shoko, but divorces her husband. Saiko visits Midori, making a great impression on Misugi with her sophistication and education. Misugi falls in love with her, and soon the two start a passionate affair. Saiko feels guilty for her betrayal of her younger cousin, referring to Misugi and herself as \"criminals\" and vowing that she will kill herself if Midori ever found out. Unknown to her, Midori finds out about the adultery but decides to keep calm about her discovery. She has short affairs with other men while her marriage with Misugi deterioates into coldness and loneliness. Years later, during a visit to the ill Saiko, Midori finally tells her that she knows all about her and Misugi's affair. Saiko, who also learned that her former husband Kadota has married again, asks Shoko to burn her diary for her and commits suicide with poison. Instead of destroying it as told, Shoko reads her mother's diary, shocked about its content, lamenting the \"sad and terrible world of adults\". The film closes with the prologue's image of Misugi in the snowy landscape.\n\nCast\n Shin Saburi as Misugi\n Mariko Okada as Midori, his wife\n Fujiko Yamamoto as Saiko, Midori's cousin\n Keiji Sada as Kadota, Saiko's husband\n Haruko Wanibuchi as Shoko, Saiko's adopted daughter\n Nobuko Otowa as Hamako, Shoko's mother\n Eijirō Yanagi as Uncle\n Yoshie Minami as Mrs. Takagi\n Masami Taura as Tsumura\n Toshiko Yabuki as Sadayo\n\nLiterary source\nOther than the film, Inoue's book works with a de-linear narrative structure. In a prologue, a nameless poet, after publishing a poem depicting a lonely hunter whose sight impressed him, is contacted by Misugi who recognised himself as the described hunter. Misugi sends him three letters, one by his niece Shoko, the second by his wife Midori, and the third by his lover Saiko. These letters take up the major part of the book, with each woman describing the events from a different perspective, a technique similar to Akira Kurosawa's 1950 film Rashomon. In a short epilogue, the poet reflects on Misugi's character.\n\nWhile staying mostly close to the original story, Gosho and his scenarist Toshio Yasumi transferred the events, taking place between the mid 1930s and late 1940s in the book, completely into the post-war era for the film. Also, the character of Shoko, Saiko's natural daughter in Inoue's story, is instead presented as the daughter of Kadota's mistress, later adopted by Saiko.\n\nLegacy\nHunting Rifle was screened at the Museum of Modern Art in 2022 as part of its \"Beyond Ozu: Hidden Gems of Shochiku Studios\" retrospective.",

The post of Russian ambassador to Chile is currently held by , incumbent since 28 June 2024.\n\nHistory of diplomatic relations\n\nDiplomatic contacts between Chile and Russia date back to the early nineteenth century, during the Chilean War of Independence which began in 1810. Captain Otto von Kotzebue, then carrying out a circumnavigation of the world aboard the brig  visited the port of Talcahuano and the city of Concepción in 1816. Baron Anatoly de Kister was assigned for a time as chargé d'affaires in 1895, with the first plenipotentiary envoy, , appointed in 1909. Augusto Matte Pérez was in turn appointed by Chile as the representative to the Russian Empire.  Relations at this time were by representatives with dual accreditation, and affairs with Chile were handled by the Russian ambassador to Brazil.  With the February Revolution in Russia in 1917, diplomatic relations were maintained with the new Russian Provisional Government, but ended shortly after the October Revolution brought the Bolsheviks to power.  Diplomatic relations would not be restored until late in the Second World War.\n\nRelations between Chile and what was by now the Soviet Union were officially restored on 11 December 1944.  A new ambassador, , was appointed on 5 September 1945, but the warmer relations were shortlived. The Radical Party of Chile had won the 1946 Chilean presidential election with the support of the Communist Party of Chile, bringing Gabriel González Videla to power as president of Chile.  Relations between the parties soon soured. Videla moved to break off relations with the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact countries on 21 October 1947, and with the Law of Permanent Defense of Democracy, banned the Communist Party of Chile.  Relations remained broken for nearly twenty years.  Relations improved with the victory in the 1964 Chilean presidential election of reformist-minded Eduardo Frei Montalva, and diplomatic relations were restored on 24 October 1964.  The embassy in Santiago was reopened, as was a cultural centre, and  was appointed as Soviet ambassador.  Relations continued to be positive under Frei Montalva's successor, Salvador Allende, but Allende was overthrown in the 1973 Chilean coup d'état, bringing right-wing dictator Augusto Pinochet to power.  The Soviet Union withdrew its representatives in protest, and relations were once more broken off.\n\nChile was ruled as a military dictatorship for the next decade and a half, with the military regime ending after the 1989 Chilean general election.  Now restored to democracy, relations with the Soviet Union were restored on 11 March 1990. The dissolution of the Soviet Union occurred in 1991, and Chile recognised Russia as its successor state. Diplomatic representatives have continued to be exchanged between the two countries since then.\n\nList of representatives (1909–present) \nRussian Empire to Chile (1909–1917)\nNameTitleAppointmentTerminationNotesEnvoy22 January 1909 1909Credentials presented on 22 January 1909Concurrently representative to BrazilEnvoy19101915Concurrently representative to BrazilEnvoy19161917Concurrently representative to Brazil\n\nRussian Provisional Government to Chile (1917)\nNameTitleAppointmentTerminationNotesEnvoy191726 November 1917 Concurrently representative to Brazil\n\nSoviet Union to Chile (1945–1991)\nNameTitleAppointmentTerminationNotesAmbassador5 September 194521 October 1947Credentials presented on 26 April 1946Diplomatic relations interrupted (1947 - 1964)Ambassador29 January 1965 19 February 1968Credentials presented on 5 March 1965Ambassador19 February 196828 March 1971Credentials presented on 3 April 1968Ambassador28 March 197122 September 1973Credentials presented on 15 June 1971Military dictatorship - Diplomatic relations interrupted (1973 - 1990)Ambassador23 August 1990 October 1991\n\nRussian Federation to Chile (1992–present)\nNameTitleAppointmentTerminationNotesVitaly ChurkinAmbassador27 March 19927 July 1992Appointment rescinded before credentials presentedAmbassador13 August 19925 June 1996Ambassador5 June 199612 August 2000Ambassador12 August 200029 March 2005Yury FilatovAmbassador3 June 20058 June 2011 Ambassador26 July 2011 17 December 2015Ambassador17 December 20155 October 2020Ambassador5 October 202028 June 2024Ambassador28 June 2024Credentials presented on 6 November 2024",

    "clean_text": "Elizabeth Graeme Fergusson, or Betsy Graeme; (February 3, 1737 – February 23, 1801) was an American poet and writer, known for The Dream (1768). She held literary salon gatherings called \"attic evenings\", based upon French salons. Her attendees included Jacob Duché, Francis Hopkinson, Benjamin Rush, and her niece, Anna Young Smith. She wrote poetry and a wide range of works, taught writing, and mentored women writers, like Annis Boudinot Stockton and Hannah Griffitts.\n\nAfter her sister Jane's death, Elizabeth raised and educated her niece Anna Young Smith and her nephew. She also raised her sister, Ann Graeme Stedman's, children after her death.\n\nIn 1772, she married a Scotsman, Hugh Henry Fergusson, who spent much of their first five years of marriage abroad. When he returned to the Philadelphia area by September 1777, Elizabeth asked General George Washington to give him a pass so that he could return to her at her estate, Graeme Park. Denied, Fergusson accepted the offer of General William Howe, Commander of the British land forces, to be a commissary to patriot prisoners in Philadelphia. He was charged with treason and banned from America. Elizabeth decided to stay in Pennsylvania and her estate was confiscated for her husband's treasonous activities and her attempts to get \nWashington to give up the war and have the colonies enter into a peace settlement.\n\nEarly years and works\nElizabeth Graeme, the sixth of nine children born to Dr. Thomas and Ann Diggs Graeme, spent much of her youth at Graeme Park, the family estate in Horsham, Pennsylvania, located outside of Philadelphia. Her mother, Ann Diggs, was the stepdaughter of colonial governor William Keith.The \"Other\" Women of Graeme Park Ann educated Elizabeth, teaching her to read and write, needlework, and social graces. Her father taught her Latin, German, and Greek. He also shared his impressions of the Scottish Enlightenment. She was taught French by a tutor in Philadelphia and also learned Italian. Elizabeth was rare among other colonial girls for receiving an  education in the classics. Although there were no public schools for children, she was among upper-class Quakers, who were more likely to make a good education available for girls. Beginning at age 15, Elizabeth wrote to entertain her readers. She shared her works — like songs, vers de société, witty yarns, and travel chronicles — with her friends.\n\nYoung adult, guardian, and poet\nElizabeth was engaged to Benjamin Franklin's son William in 1757. The father and son went to England and Elizabeth's relationship with William ended in 1759, as desired by both families.\n\nAfter the death of her sister (Jane), Elizabeth became the guardian and educator of her niece, Anna Young Smith, and nephew. Elizabeth encouraged the poetic talents of Anna, introducing her to the literary circles of Philadelphia. Anna's poem An Ode to Gratitude was dedicated to Elizabeth as a sign of her gratefulness.\n\nIn 1764, Elizabeth traveled to London at the urging of her mother, whose health was failing. Another reason to travel to London, was to lift her spirits from the recent breakup. There until 1765, she met esteemed literary and scientific people. In London, Elizabeth met Laurence Sterne and King George III. While she was in England, she kept a travel journal, which was later circulated and read among her peers in Philadelphia.\n\nWhile in England, Elizabeth learned that her mother died on May 29, 1765. Back at Graeme Park, Elizabeth assumed the role of female head-of-household. Ann Graeme Stedman, her sister, died soon after their mother, and Elizabeth raised Ann's children. Elizabeth was then her father's lone surviving child. \n\nAside from writing poetry, Elizabeth's main literary project was the translation of François Fénelon's Les Aventures de Télémaque from the original French. She worked on it from 1765 to 1768, in part to manage her depression after losing her mother and sister. In the same time period, she wrote The Dream of the Philosophical Farmer about the wisdom of banning the import of British goods.\n\nSalon gatherings\nShe hosted \"attic evenings\"—salon gatherings for her elite male and female acquaintances which was among the earliest American salons.\nThe Oxford Companion to women's writing in the United States said it was \"the most distinguished intellectual salon in British America.\" The weekly meetings were based upon the French salon. Talented writers like Jacob Duché, Hannah Griffitts, Francis Hopkinson, Benjamin Rush, Anna Young Smith, and Annis Boudinot Stockton attended her gatherings.\n\nPoet and writer \nHer poems showed her emotional side. One of her longest and most emotional poems was Il Penseroso or The Deserted Wife. The poem had four parts: hope, solitude, doubt, and adversity. The poem traces the progress of her grief as she feels abandoned by her husband. In part one, Fergusson is angry at her husband, Hugh, because he deserted her but, more importantly, because there were rumors he had impregnated a servant. Eventually, Ferguson realizes that she is not alone in her anger and grief. She realizes that she has many things in common with other loyalist women such as Grace Growden Galloway.  In the second part of her poem, she writes \"My Shattered Fortunes I with calmness Bore / A Loss in Common but with thousand more\".\n\nShe is known for the mentorship that she provided to Hannah Griffitts, Susanna Wright, Annis Boudinot Stockton, and sisters Elizabeth Willing Powel and Mary Willing Byrd. Biographer David S. Shields said, \"No other author did as much to encourage  writing in the eighteenth-century America.\"\n\nMarriage\nElizabeth met the younger Scot, Hugh Henry Fergusson (b. 1748), and they were married on April 21, 1772, in Philadelphia, without her father's knowledge or approval. Hugh left Philadelphia for Scotland in the summer. Her father knew that the couple wanted to marry, and he suggested they wait until Hugh returned from Scotland. Elizabeth's father died on September 4, 1772, of a stroke, never having learned of his daughter's marriage. By September 21, having not heard from her husband, Elizabeth made a public announcement of her marriage, as advised by John Dickinson, a lawyer.\n\nIn September 1775, Hugh went to England on personal business, and from there sailed for Jamaica in February 1776. He arrived in New York on July 19, 1777. Hugh arrived in Germantown by September 29, when Elizabeth sent a letter to General George Washington asking for his assistance to allow Hugh to return to their home at Graeme Park,  north of Germantown along a southwest branch of the Neshaminy Creek. She stated that her husband had not participated in the war and would not aid the enemy. Washington did not give him a pass. Hugh was appointed by General Howe to work in Philadelphia as the commissary of prisoners. In June 1778, Hugh went with the British army to New York. He was charged with treason and when he was banned from America, he sailed for London. He never returned to Elizabeth, and she did not move to England as her husband asked. In 1777 and 1778, Elizabeth carried a letter from Jacob Duché, at her husband's urging, that requested that Washington give up the fight against the British and end the war and she tried to bribe an official to arrange for a peace settlement. Graeme Park was confiscated in 1779 for her and her husband's loyalist activities.\n\nConfiscation of Graeme Park\nIn 1779, Elizabeth was forced to vacate the property and for two years lived with various acquaintances and family members. Elizabeth Ferguson wrote letters to get help regaining her property after it was confiscated. These letters tended to be forceful and vigorous in order for her to get the help she needed.\n\nHer father left the property at Graeme Park in her name, though under colonial law, Elizabeth was a feme covert, meaning that all of her property belonged to her husband when they were married. Since Hugh was abroad, she petitioned the government in 1781 to act as a surrogate patriarch and return the estate to her.\n\nAfter two years of petitioning the government, Elizabeth finally regained the right to her property and moved back to Graeme Park in 1781. In 1791, however, Elizabeth could no longer afford the upkeep of the property and was forced to sell.\n\nLater years and death\nFor the final ten years of her life, Elizabeth lived with friends and wrote voraciously, publishing some of her poetry and participated in the writing of commonplace books with a number of her female acquaintances, such as Hannah Griffitts.\n\nAs her health declined, she was cared for by Betsy Stedman. Elizabeth died February 23, 1801, at the Billet at Hatboro, Pennsylvania. Elizabeth is buried on the south side of the churchyard of Christ Church in Philadelphia. Some of her siblings and her parents were buried at the cemetery.",

Mahadji Shinde constructed Gopal Mandir, which was later on reconstructed by Maharani Bayzabai Raje Shinde. Shrimant Bayzabai also developed the city by developing Daulatganj. Maharajah Shrimant Jayaajirao Saheb Shinde (II) (1843 - 1886 CE) also developed Ujjain by developing Nai Sadak, Sarafa Bazar, Ghasmandi and other areas of the city. The last ruler of Scindia Dynasty Maharaja Jiwajirao Shinde constructed Chhatri Chowk, Madhav College, and Achyutanand Vyayamshala (with Pustake and Dingre). Jiwaji Rao Shinde also reconstructed Maharaj Vada in 1940 CE near Shri Mahakaaleshwar Temple which was originally built by Ranojirao Shinde in 1732 CE and further developments were made by Shreenath Mahadji Shinde from 1764 to 1794 CE.\nalt=Bade Ganeshji|thumb|Bade Ganeshji\n\nBade Ganeshji ka Mandir \nChintaman Ganesh temple \nthumb|right|Chintaman Ganesh Ujjain.\n\nChintaman means \"the assurer of freedom from worldly anxieties\". This temple is built across the Shipra(Kshipra) river on the Fatehabad railway line. The Ganesh idol in this temple is supposed to be swayambhu - born of itself. Riddhi and Siddhi, the consorts of Ganesha, are seated on either side of Ganesha. The temple is considered to be of considerable antiquity. The artistically carved pillars in the assembly hall date back to the Paramara period. The temple is about 15 km from the main city. Every Wednesday people come for special darshana.\n\n Harsidhhi Temple \nthumb|Harsiddhi Temple\nThis famous temple is said to have been built by famous King Vikramāditya. Vikramaditya is said to have visited Miyani, then known as Minalpur, a port city ruled by Prabhatsen Chavda of Chawda dynasty.  Vikramadiya was blessed by the Devi. He requested Harsidhhi Mata, to come to his kingdom at Ujjain, where he would worship her daily. She is also known as Vahanvati Mata.\n\nThe temple was reconstructed during the Maratha period and has two pillars adorned with lamps, that are special features of Maratha art. There is an ancient well on the premises, and an artistic pillar adorns the top of it.\n\n Kal Bhairava temple \nthumb|right|Kal Bhairav Mandir entrance\n\nThe worship of the eight Bhairavas is a part of Saivite tradition, and the chief among them is Kala Bhairava. The Kal Bhairava temple is believed to have been built by King Bhadrasen, on the banks of the Shipra. Mentioned in the Avanti Khanda of the Skanda Purana. Important for the Tantric Kapalika and Aghora sects, of which Ujjain was a prominent centre. Beautiful paintings in the Malwa style once decorated the temple walls, only traces of which are visible. The village of Bhairogarh, famous for its printing, takes its name from the temple, and is located very near.\n\n Mangalnath temple \nShiva or Mahadeva is the deity which is worshipped in Mangalnath temple.\n\nGopal Mandir \nConstructed by Bayajibai Shinde, the queen of Maharajah Daulat Rao Shinde, in the 19th century. The door in the inner sanctum is believed to have been carried to Ghazni from the Somnath temple and from thence by Mahmud Shah Abdali to Lahore, from where it was rescued by Mahadji Scindia.\n\n Other temples \nNavagraha Mandir (Triveni) - A temple dedicated to the nine planets.\nRam Janardhan Temple.\nHarihara Tirtha.\nMallikarjuna Tirtha.\n\nMatsyendranath \nThis is very attractive spot on the banks of Shipra River, quite close to the Bhartrihari Caves and the Gadkalika temple. The Gadkalika temple is where poet Kalidas is believed to have obtained the grace of Kali. The shrine is dedicated to a leader of the Natha sect of Shaivism- Matsyendranath. It is also venerated by Muslims. Excavations here have yielded artifacts dating to the 6th and 7th century BC.\n\nBhartrihari Caves \nBhartrihari, the step brother of Vikramaditya, is believed to have lived and meditated here after renouncing worldly life. His famous works, Shringarshataka, Vairagyashataka, and Nitishataka, were possibly written here\n\nOther places \nthumb|right|Sun Dial at the Ved Shala\nthumb|The Ram Ghat\n Vedh Shala - An observatory built by Maharaja Jai Singh II in 1725.

She entered service as P42 and was renamed Unbroken on 1 February 1943.\n\nCareer\n\nUnbroken was commissioned on 29 January 1942 as P42.\nAfter work up trials in Holy Loch, Unbroken went out to join the 10th Flotilla at Malta, with a work-up patrol from Gibraltar. She spent most of her wartime career in the Mediterranean. She landed saboteurs under the command of Captain Peter Churchill at Antibes in the south of France. She then proceeded to Malta to reform the 10th Flotilla in June 1942. She was the only submarine operating from Malta until ,  and  joined. She took part in Operations Harpoon and Vigorous, in June 1942. In July 1942, Unbroken attacked the main west coast railway line on the Italian mainland, and succeeded in blocking the line for 24 hours. However, she received return fire from coastal artillery and sustained a hit on the battery, forcing her to return to Malta. She was badly damaged in October 1942, by a counter-attack by Italian escorts after hitting a tanker, and was again repaired at Malta.\nthumb|left|Lieutenant Alastair C G Mars, DSO, RN, commanding officer of HMS Unbroken\nDuring her time in the Mediterranean, she sank the Italian merchants Edda and Bologna (the former French Monaco), the Italian pilot vessel F 20 / Enrica, and the Italian auxiliary minesweeper No. 17/Milano. She also damaged the Italian sailing vessel Vale Formoso II, the German (former Norwegian) tanker Regina, and most significantly, the Italian heavy cruiser Bolzano and the Italian light cruiser Muzio Attendolo during Operation Pedestal. Bolzano was hit in her oil tanks and set ablaze; she had to be beached at Panarea island; the Attendolo lost sixty feet of bow. Bolzano was out of action for the rest of the war.\n\nUnbroken also attacked the Italian merchant Algerino, but missed her with her torpedoes. She later damaged the Italian merchant Titania, north-west of Tripoli, Libya. Titania was taken in tow by the . Titania was sunk early the next day by . Unbroken returned to the UK in December 1943.\n\nIn Soviet service\nUnbroken was transferred on loan to the Soviet Union on 26 June 1944, where she was renamed V-2 (Cyrillic: В-2). Sailing under Soviet flag she sank the German submarine chaser UJ-1220 on 12 October 1944. She spent four years in Soviet service before being returned to the Royal Navy in 1949. She was scrapped at Gateshead from 9 May 1950.",

She was the third child of John Horton McKay, a Pākehā storekeeper, and Irihāpeti Te Paea, a Māori woman whose tribal associations were with Waikato and Ngāti Pūkeko of Whakatāne. She learned housekeeping and nursing skills, and became a devout Christian. Two of her brothers became respected Māori language interpreters. Catherine married William Carran, a stock keeper, at Waitetuna, Raglan, on 29 October 1860.\n\nIn 1861 William moved from the Waikato to Archibald and James Campbell's Waimahaka station in Southland, where Catherine joined him. Within a year they moved to the ferry house at Fortrose, where William was the ferryman at the Mataura River mouth for six years. They then moved to a farm at Seaward Bush, near Invercargill. William drowned in June 1871, and Catherine returned to Fortrose. Her brother Ben McKay came from the Waikato to help her and stayed on. Catherine began nursing for settler women. In about 1872 she bought a small farm and on 11 November 1872 married William Henry Patterson, a miner from the United States. Catherine continued work as midwife and housekeeper at Fortrose. She died on 6 November 1935.",

    "clean_text": "thumb|Slave market in Aceh\n250px|thumb|A typical Javanese man-of-war ship. The Javanese call their man-of-war ships, Cathurs. The slaves are all seated below deck and do the rowing with oars, while the warriors remain above deck and do the fighting.\n\nChattel slavery existed in the territory that would become the modern state of Indonesia until the 20th century. Due to the fact that the Maritime South Asian archipelago corresponding to Indonesia was not unified until 1949, the history of slavery in Indonesia is not uniform, but did have common features and a somewhat common history.\n\nSlavery and slave trade is known to have existed during the Ancient Hindu-Buddhistic states in Indonesia, though the information is somewhat limited. \nWhen the islands converted to Islam and transformed into Islamic sultanates during the 15th century, the institution of slavery came to be managed in accordance with Islamic law and therefore took on similar characteristics as the slavery in the rest of the Muslim world, and non-Muslim peoples were captured by Muslim pirates from the Sulu and Celebes who sold them to slavery in the Islamic sultanates.\n\nFrom the 17th-century onward, the Company rule in the Dutch East Indies (1610–1800) and then the Colonial Dutch East Indies (1800–1949) expanded over the archipelago. The Dutch colonists used slave labor in their agriculture. The Dutch banned slave trade in 1811 and slavery in 1860. The Dutch prohibition of slavery expanded in parallel with the Dutch control ove the archipelago, and by 1910, slavery in the East Indies was seen as effectively abolished, though cases of chattel slavery were still discovered as late as the 1940s.\n\nHindu-Buddhist antiquity\n\nThe rulers in the Hindu-Buddhist states in Indonesia are known to have used slave labor to cultivate their land, which was common in the Indonesian states, where there was no lack of land but rather of people and laborers to cultivate it, and slaves are noted to have existed in  both royal palaces and temples in ancient Indonesia.Klein, M. A. (2014). Historical Dictionary of Slavery and Abolition. Storbritannien: Rowman & Littlefield Publishers. p. 216\n\nSlave owning was reportedly not restricted to royalty; it was reported that commoners often owned slaves, and that rich merchants could own hundreds of slaves.Klein, M. A. (2014). Historical Dictionary of Slavery and Abolition. Storbritannien: Rowman & Littlefield Publishers. p. 216\n\nIn 15th-century Melaka, both enslaved laborers, concubines and debt bondage was noted to exist.Klein, M. A. (2014). Historical Dictionary of Slavery and Abolition. Storbritannien: Rowman & Littlefield Publishers. p. 216\n\nIslamic sultanates\n\nThe introduction of Islam influenced the institution of slavery, which was adjusted to fit Islamic law. Islamic law prohibited the enslavement of Muslims, and non-Muslim peoples therefore became the preferred targets for enslavement, and victimized by Muslim pirates from the Sulu Islands, who became the slave suppliers of the Islamic sultanates in South Asia.Klein, M. A. (2014). Historical Dictionary of Slavery and Abolition. Storbritannien: Rowman & Littlefield Publishers. p. 216-217Warren, J. F. (2007). The Sulu Zone, 1768-1898: The Dynamics of External Trade, Slavery, and Ethnicity in the Transformation of a Southeast Asian Maritime State. Singapore: Singapore University Press.\n\nThe Royal harems in South East Asia include the harems of the Aceh Sultanate on Sumatra, the Mataram Sultanate on Java, the Banten Sultanate on Sumatra, and the Gowa Sultanate of Sulawesi. \nThe conversion of Islam to East Asia made the Islamic law around sexual slavery and other forms of slavery relevant; however, South East Asia did not practice Sharia fully but combined it with customary law, which resulted in harems and slavery being partially different there from how they appeared in the rest of the Muslim world.Clarence-Smith, W. G. (2007). Eunuchs and Concubines in the History of Islamic Southeast Asia. Manusya: Journal of Humanities, 10(4), 8-19. https://doi.org/10.1163/26659077-01004001\n\nThe Royal harems in South East Asia where generally relatively small with the exception of the one in Aceh, which reached a considerable size in the 16th- and 17th-centuries.Clarence-Smith, W. G. (2007). Eunuchs and Concubines in the History of Islamic Southeast Asia. Manusya: Journal of Humanities, 10(4), 8-19. https://doi.org/10.1163/26659077-01004001 \nEunuchs (sida-sida) where not as common in South East Asia as in the rest if the Muslim world, with the exception of the Persian influenced Aceh Sultanate, where there where about 500 eunuchs in 1619–1622, before the use of eunuchs ended around 1700.Clarence-Smith, W. G. (2007). Eunuchs and Concubines in the History of Islamic Southeast Asia. Manusya: Journal of Humanities, 10(4), 8-19. https://doi.org/10.1163/26659077-01004001  \nThe court of Aceh also used enslaved dancing boys (Nias) of the age 8–12, who were also used for sexual slavery, as late as in the 1870s.\n\nIn contrast to the rest of the Muslim world, the concubines (gundik) in the harems of South East Asia where not always slaves, but could also be free Muslim women, which was illegal in Islamic Law. Particularly in Java, the Javanese aristocracy and royalty frequently used free women as concubines.Clarence-Smith, W. G. (2007). Eunuchs and Concubines in the History of Islamic Southeast Asia. Manusya: Journal of Humanities, 10(4), 8-19. https://doi.org/10.1163/26659077-01004001  \nEnslaved concubines where however used alongside free concubines. Girls where kidnapped from their villages or by sea by pirates and slave traders. \nThe Banten Sultanate followed Islamic law more strictly and therefore banned free Muslim concubines and only used enslaved non-Muslim concubines in accordance with Islamic law.Clarence-Smith, W. G. (2007). Eunuchs and Concubines in the History of Islamic Southeast Asia. Manusya: Journal of Humanities, 10(4), 8-19. https://doi.org/10.1163/26659077-01004001  Banten acquired their concubines by enslaving girls from 'those villages which during the period of Islamisation had refused to embrace the new religion, and had thereupon been declared to be slaves'.Clarence-Smith, W. G. (2007). Eunuchs and Concubines in the History of Islamic Southeast Asia. Manusya: Journal of Humanities, 10(4), 8-19. https://doi.org/10.1163/26659077-01004001 \nChinese slave girls (mui tsai or anak beli), where sold for use as slave concubines in the harems of Aceh, which still occurred during the Interwar period, when the sales where called adoptions to avoid attention from the colonial Dutch authorities, who banned the slave trade.Clarence-Smith, W. G. (2007). Eunuchs and Concubines in the History of Islamic Southeast Asia. Manusya: Journal of Humanities, 10(4), 8-19. https://doi.org/10.1163/26659077-01004001  \nIn contrast to normal Islamic law, the child of a concubine where not given equal status to the child of a wife, and could even be deprived of inheritance rights; to be the slave of a concubine was seen as shameful, and many concubines in Aceh used contraception and practiced infanticide for this reason.Clarence-Smith, W. G. (2007). Eunuchs and Concubines in the History of Islamic Southeast Asia. Manusya: Journal of Humanities, 10(4), 8-19. https://doi.org/10.1163/26659077-01004001\n\nAnother custom breaking Islamic law was that Muslim slave women could be sold to non-Muslim men, such as Chinese men, which became a big trade in the 18th century.  \nIn Jeddah, Kingdom of Hejaz on the Arabian Peninsula, the Arab king Ali bin Hussein, King of Hejaz had in his palace 20 young pretty Javanese girls from Java (modern day Indonesia).\nA Chinese non-Muslim man had a female Indonesian who was of Muslim Arab Hadhrami Sayyid origin in Solo, the Dutch East Indies, in 1913 which was scandalous in the eyes of Ahmad Surkati and his Al-Irshad Al-Islamiya.السودانيون والعلويون Al-Sūdānīyūn wa'l-'Alawīyūn  الارشاد Al-Irshād (Al-Irsyad, Al-Irsjad, Al-Irshad)  October 14, 1920  pp. 2-3\n\nThe local royal rulers in South East Asia continued also their custom of slave concubinage after they had become vassals of Western powers; in Lampung, slave concubines were still kept as late as World War I.Clarence-Smith, W. G. (2007). Eunuchs and Concubines in the History of Islamic Southeast Asia. Manusya: Journal of Humanities, 10(4), 8-19. https://doi.org/10.1163/26659077-01004001  \nIt is not known when the custom of slave concubines ended in South East Asia, but the custom of harems, polygyny and concubinage was met with criticism from the 1870s among the local indigenous elite after it had been identified by the colonial powers as a reason for the decay of the local indigenous rulers.Clarence-Smith, W. G. (2007). Eunuchs and Concubines in the History of Islamic Southeast Asia. Manusya: Journal of Humanities, 10(4), 8-19. https://doi.org/10.1163/26659077-01004001\n\nDutch East Indies\n\nthumb|180px|Njai maid in a Dutch household, artwork by Auguste van Pers \nDuring the Company rule in the Dutch East Indies (1610–1800), the Dutch established a significant plantation economy on Java. Due to the difficulty of engaging free laborers, the Dutch colonists started to use slaves as agriculture laborers, and a significant slave market was established in Batavia.Klein, M. A. (2014). Historical Dictionary of Slavery and Abolition. Storbritannien: Rowman & Littlefield Publishers. p. 217\n\nThe Dutch banned slave trade in the Dutch colonial empire in 1818, and slavery in 1863.Klein, M. A. (2014). Historical Dictionary of Slavery and Abolition. Storbritannien: Rowman & Littlefield Publishers. p. 217\nHowever, slavery in the Dutch East Indies predated the Dutch prohibition in the rest of the Empire. Slave trade was banned in the East Indies in 1811.Campbell, G. (2004). Structure of Slavery in Indian Ocean Africa and Asia. Storbritannien: Taylor & Francis.\nDuring the first half of the 19th century, when the Western powers banned slavery in their colonies, The Netherlands were internationally criticized for the slavery in the East Indies. On 1 January 1860, the Dutch banned slavery in the Dutch East Indies.Campbell, G. (2004). Structure of Slavery in Indian Ocean Africa and Asia. Storbritannien: Taylor & Francis.\n\nThe Dutch slavery abolition could only be enforced in the parts of Indonesia which were under Dutch control and thus subject to Dutch law, which meant that slavery was only abolished in about a quarter of Indonesia, such as Java.Campbell, G. (2004). Structure of Slavery in Indian Ocean Africa and Asia. Storbritannien: Taylor & Francis.\nEmancipation thus expanded in parallel with Dutch colonial expansion, and in 1910, when the Dutch had effective control over the entire archipelago, emancipation was considered to have been effectively enforced.Klein, M. A. (2014). Historical Dictionary of Slavery and Abolition. Storbritannien: Rowman & Littlefield Publishers. p. 217Campbell, G. (2004). Structure of Slavery in Indian Ocean Africa and Asia. Storbritannien: Taylor & Francis.\n\nIn the 1920s the Dutch estimated to the Temporary Slavery Commission (TSC) that chattel slavery may still exist in remote areas of the Dutch East Indies where Dutch control was only nominal, but that it was difficult to get access to information about the issue.Miers, S. (2003). Slavery in the Twentieth Century: The Evolution of a Global Problem. Storbritannien: AltaMira Press. p. 101\n\nIn practice however the Dutch colonial authorities never truly had full control over the East Indies, and chattel slavery is known to have existed in some parts of the archipelago as late as the 1940s.Campbell, G. (2004). Structure of Slavery in Indian Ocean Africa and Asia. Storbritannien: Taylor & Francis.\n\nGallery",

As a word, \"freeborn\" means born free, rather than in slavery or bondage or vassalage. Lilburne argued for basic human rights that he termed \"freeborn rights\", which he defined as being rights that every human being is born with, as opposed to rights bestowed by government or by human law. John Lilburne's concept of freeborn rights, and the writings of Richard Overton another Leveller, may have influenced the concept of unalienable rights, cites Andrew Sharp 1983, p. 177 (Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.) mentioned in the United States Declaration of Independence.\n\nOther historians, according to Edward Ashbee, consider that it was not the tradition of \"Freeborn Englishmen\", as espoused by Lilburne, Overton, John Milton and John Locke, that was the major influence on the concept of unalienable rights in the United States Declaration of Independence, but rather \"an attempt to recreate 'civic republicanism' established in classical Greece and Rome\".",

    "clean_text": "The Texas Open Beaches Act is a U.S. state of Texas law, passed in 1959 and amended in 1991, which guarantees free public access to beaches on the Gulf of Mexico:\n\nThe public... shall have the free and unrestricted right of ingress and egress to and from the state-owned beaches bordering on the seaward shore of the Gulf of Mexico ... extending from the line of mean low tide to the line of vegetation bordering on the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nAfter major storms, Texas GLO guidelines indicate that beachfront residents may not rebuild their homes due to the act \nsuch as some Galveston homes affected by Hurricane Alicia in 1983.  Additionally, repairs may only be made in certain circumstances, and then only on structures above the mean high-tide line.\n\nOngoing litigation continues to clarify the effect of the act on beachfront property owners. The Texas Supreme Court has made it clear that once acquired, public easements do not \"roll\" when the mean high-tide line changes due to an avulsive event such as a hurricane.  The state will own the \"wet beach\" (any land seaward of the mean-high-tide line), but the \"dry beach\" (beach that is landward of the mean-high-tide line, but seaward of the vegetation line) may be privately owned, regardless of any pre-existing easements on the beach prior to the avulsive event.  However, an easement will \"roll\" with the vegetation line as long as its movement is gradual/natural and not caused by an avulsive event like a hurricane.  Some have criticized the court's decision based on the fact that hurricanes result in \"natural\" erosion; critics argue that the distinction between what is \"avulsive\" and what is \"gradual\" is unclear.",

At the time of his election, he was old and blind in one eye, and so he was given the sobriquet Stravoamaseias (), i.e. the blind of Amasya.\n\nHis short reign has to be considered in the context of the clash between the pro-Calvinist Patriarch Cyril I of Constantinople, supported by the Protestant Dutch and English ambassadors to the Ottoman capital, and his opponents supported by the Catholic French, Austrian and Republic of Venice ambassadors. The latter were successful at persuading the Grand vizier to depose Cyril I on 12 April 1623 and to appoint in his place Gregory IV, the head of the pro-Western faction.\n\nEugenia Kermeli reports, \"In 1623, the metropolitan of Amaseia Gregory promised [the French ambassador] Cécy to appoint metropolitans friendly to Rome in case he was elected\".\n\nGregory IV proved to be incompetent and could not pay the appointment fee (peshtesh) due to the Ottoman Sultan. Further the Metropolitans and the bishops were unsatisfied with him because he had not been canonically elected by the Holy Synod. Thus, on 18 June 1623, the Holy Synod deposed Gregory IV and formally elected Anthimus II of Constantinople in his place.\n\nAfter his deposition, Gregory IV was exiled to the island of Rhodes. The date of his death is not known.\n\nNotes and references",

    "title": "You Will Never Know Why",
    "clean_text": "You Will Never Know Why is the third album by American experimental pop act Sweet Trip, released on September 28, 2009, by Darla Records. It marks a departure from the electronic sounds of their previous releases, featuring more traditional song structures and a more mainstream indie pop sound throughout.\n\nBackground \nAfter the release of their second album, Velocity : Design : Comfort, Sweet Trip took a nearly three-year hiatus from performing and recording, lasting from 2004 to 2006. Roberto Burgos used this hiatus to improve his guitar playing, so that future recordings of songs would not need to rely so heavily on effects to hit the notes and chords he was aiming to play. In 2006, the band reformed, with founding member Viet Le leaving and Rob Uytingco joining to contribute live drums to performances and recordings.\n\nSongs for the album developed from practice sessions where the band would play with just guitar alone, with them deciding that the more \"raw and bare and simple\" songs would be what they would focus on for their next album; the band agreed an attempt to recreate the sound of Velocity : Design : Comfort in particular would be a disservice to that album. The band also focused on making more traditional verse-chorus structured songs, whereas previous releases had the band building songs as they went, leading to long and unconventionally structured songs.\n\nBurgos and Valerie Cooper have gone on record stating some of the songs had been in the works for many years prior to the album's release, with the song \"Air Supply\" written around the same time as \"Dsco\" from Velocity : Design : Comfort, which itself debuted live in 1999, four years prior to that album's release. Also written years earlier were the songs \"Milk\" and the intro and outro for \"Acting\", both of which were created around the same time as Velocity : Design : Comfort. The song \"Silence\", a bonus track from the 2021 remaster, was performed solo by Cooper at the 1999 wedding of the eponymous Darla of Darla Records; the owner of March Records, who was in attendance, told her that the band should write more songs like that, and that \"it's better, people will like that better\".\n\nArtwork \nThe original cover artwork for You Will Never Know Why features a razor blade, drawn by Aaron Porter. Burgos and Cooper were not sure what to do for the artwork, and eventually Porter drew the razor after much indecision, which the band went with for the final cover. Burgos has stated neither he nor Cooper were fans of the original artwork, nor the association with the razor and self-harm, so the band chose to create entirely new artwork alongside a short comic for the 2021 remaster.\n\nThe remaster's artwork features drawings of Burgos and Cooper lying around a portrait of a vampire, from the comic included in physical editions of the album. This artwork was met with criticism from fans, leading to Darla Records repressing versions of the remaster with the original razor artwork.\n\n 2021 Remaster Comic \nPhysical editions of the 2021 remaster of You Will Never Know Why come with a short comic, with the story written by Cooper and artwork done by YobKiss. It follows an unnamed vampire, who sees an in-comic counterpart of Cooper writing her suicide note, about to kill herself with a razor with her name on it (based off the design of the razor on the original cover art). The vampire then flies through Cooper's window, biting her and turning her into a vampire, then taking her razor. He then places the razor in a case also containing a razor with Burgos's name on it, implying the same had happened to him too. The comic ends with Burgos and Cooper happily dancing together, both now vampires.\n\nTrack listing\n\nPersonnel\nCredits are adapted from the album's liner notes.\n\nSweet Trip\n Roberto Burgos – vocals, guitar, synthesizer, programming\n Valerie Cooper – vocals, guitar, synthesizer\n\nProduction\n Sweet Trip – production, mastering\n\nAdditional personnel\n Aaron Porter – bass, artwork\n Rob Uytingco – drums",

    "clean_text": "Professional Football Club Etar 1924 (), commonly referred to as Etar 1924 Veliko Tarnovo, is a former Bulgarian professional football club based in Veliko Tarnovo. They were last competing in the 2012–13 season of the Bulgarian A Professional Football Group, the top tier of professional football in Bulgaria. The club replaced the old FC Etar (Veliko Tarnovo), which won the Bulgarian championship in 1991.\n\nThe club's home ground had been Ivaylo Stadium since 1958, and their main nicknames were the Bolyars and the Violets, the latter in reference to the colour of their home kit, which was often mistaken for purple.\n\nThe club folded following the end of the 2012–13 A PFG due to financial difficulties. Etar Veliko Tarnovo acquired the license of Botev Debelets and played in the Bulgarian V AFG in the 2013/14 season.\n\nHonours\n\nDomestic\nBulgarian East B PFG\nWinners (1): 2011–12\nBulgarian North-West V AFG\nWinners (1): 2002–03\n\nHistory\n150px|thumb|right|Etar crest used from 2002 to 2012\nThe club was founded as Etar 1924 in 2002, following severe financial problems plaguing the historical FC Etar, which folded in 2003. In their first season, they were promoted to B PFG as champions of the North-West V AFG.\n\nIn the 2004–05 season, Etar had their best Bulgarian Cup run, beating Dorostol Silistra and Slavia Sofia before losing to Levski Sofia in the Round of 16.\n\nIn September 2010, Velin Kefalov had been appointed as a manager of Etar 1924. He led the team to the third place in the West B PFG. Because Chernomorets Pomorie did not receive a licence to play in the A PFG, Etar competed in the promotion playoff, but lost 3–1 to Svetkavitsa Targovishte.\n\nIn June 2011, Kefalov left the club and was replaced by Georgi Todorov in the role of head coach. Todorov resigned after the first half of the 2011–12 season and was replaced by Tsanko Tsvetanov. А streak of good form in the second half of the season ensured promotion to the A PFG on 23 May 2012 with 1–0 home win against Nesebar.\n\nThe team finished the autumn part of the 2012-2013 A PFG in last place of the standings. As a result, the second half of the 2012-13 A PFG season saw a huge turnover in player and managerial personnel (Tsvetanov had already been replaced by Serdar Dayat). Despite a bright start to the spring season, the increasing financial uncertainty continued to plague the team and Etar relocated to Sliven, in part due to a conflict of interest with the Veliko Tarnovo supporter groups and the municipality, which contributed to the club remaining in the relegation zone. In May 2013, the team was practically dissolved and Etar's remaining A PFG opponents were awarded 3:0 wins by default until the end of the season.\n\nThe legacy of the club was succeeded by SFC Etar Veliko Tarnovo, which was established shortly after Etar 1924 folded.\n\nLast squad\n\nForeign players\nUp to three non-EU nationals can be registered and given a squad number for the first team in the A PFG. Those non-EU nationals with European ancestry can claim citizenship from the nation their ancestors came from. If a player does not have European ancestry he can claim Bulgarian citizenship after playing in Bulgaria for 5 years.\n\nManagerial history\nThis is a list of the last seven Etar managers:\nNameNatFromToHonoursEmil DimitrovMay 2005June 2006–Stoyan PetrovJune 200625 June 2007–Velin Kefalov25 June 20076 October 2008–Sasho Angelov6 October 200823 December 2008–Nikolay Arnaudov23 December 200821 September 2010–Velin Kefalov21 September 201030 June 2011–Georgi Todorov6 July 201112 December 2011–Tsanko Tsvetanov30 December 201115 October 2012B PFG ChampionsSerdar Dayat22 October 201220 April 2013–Grigor Petkov28 April 20133 May 2013–Rumen Dankov4 May 20138 May 2013–\n\nAs of 8 May 2013",

    "clean_text": "Ward No. 22, Kolkata Municipal Corporation is an administrative division of Kolkata Municipal Corporation in Borough No. 4, covering parts of Posta neighbourhood in North Kolkata, in the Indian state of West Bengal.\n\nHistory\nAttempts were made to establish a municipal corporation at Kolkata from the middle of the 19th century. The electoral system was introduced for the first time in 1847, and 4 of the 7 board members were elected by the rate payers. In 1852 the board was replaced by a new one and in 1863 a new body was formed. As per old records, in 1872 there were 25 wards in Kolkata (spellings as in use at that time) – 1. Shyampukur, 2. Kumartuli, 3. Bartala, 4. Sukea Street, 5. Jorabagan, 6. Jorasanko, 7. Barabazar, 8. Kolutola, 9. Muchipara, 10. Boubazar, 11. Padmapukur, 12. Waterloo Street, 13. Fenwick Bazar, 14. Taltala, 15. Kalinga, 16. Park Street, 17. Victoria Terrace, 18. Hastings, 19. Entali, 20. Beniapukur, 21. Baliganj-Tollyganj, 22. Bhabanipur, 23. Alipur, 24.Ekbalpur and 25. Watganj. A new municipal corporation was created in 1876, wherein 48 commissioners were elected and 24 were appointed by the government. With the implementation of the Municipal Consolidation Act of 1888 the area under the jurisdiction of the municipal corporation was enlarged. Certain areas were already there but more parts of them were added (current spellings) - Entally, Manicktala, Beliaghata, Ultadanga, Chitpur, Cossipore, Beniapukur, Ballygunge, Watganj and Ekbalpur, and Garden Reach and Tollygunj. The Calcutta Municipal Act of 1923 brought about important changes. It liberalised the constitution along democratic lines.Bagchi, Amiya Kumar, Wealth and Work in Calcutta, 1860-1921, in Calcutta, the Living City, Vol. I, edited by Sukanta Chaudhuri, p. 213-215, Oxford University Press, .\n\nThe state government superseded the Corporation in 1948 and the Calcutta Municipal Act of 1951 came into force. Adult franchise was introduced in municipal elections in 1962. With the addition of certain areas in the southern parts of the city, the number of wards increased from 75 to 144.\n\nGeography\nWard No. 22 is bordered on the north by the Port Trust’s road leading from the Hooghly River bank to Kalikrishna Tagore Street and Darpa Narayan Tagore Street; on the east by Jadulal Mallick Road, Jogndra Kaviraj Row, Kalakar Street and Jag Mohan Mullick Street; on the south by the Port Trust’s road leading from Mahatma Gandhi Road and Cotton Street to the Hooghly River Bank; and on the west by the Hooghly River and Maharshi Devendra Road.Kolkata: Detail Maps of 141 Wards with Street Directory.

    "title": "Ralph Rodgerson",
    "clean_text": "Ralph Rodgerson (30 December 1892 – 10 July 1939) was an English professional footballer who made 53 appearances in the Football League playing as a full back for Huddersfield Town and Leeds United. He was on the books of Burnley without playing for their first team, played in the Scottish League for Dundee both during the First World War (on loan from Huddersfield) and afterwards, and played non-League football for Pallion Institute, Sunderland West End, Spennymoor United and Carlisle United.\n\nLife and career\nRodgerson was born in Sunderland in 1892, a son of Joseph Rodgerson, an iron worker, and his wife Margaret. The 1911 Census records the 18-year-old Rodgerson also an iron worker and living with his extended family in the Pallion district of the town. He played football for a local team, Pallion Institute, and spent time with Burnley during the 1912–13 season before signing for another Second Division club, Huddersfield Town, in 1913. Rodgerson made his first-team debut on 17 October 1914, standing in at right back for the injured Willie McLaren in a 3–2 win away to Fulham. It was his last senior outing of the season, at the end of which competitive football was suspended for the duration of the First World War.\n\nHe was able to play for Huddersfield in the wartime matches: in 1917, the Sheffield-based Sports Special assessed him as a \"dashing left back—a determined tackier, with big clearances in both boots\", but warned him against \"over-robustness\", suggesting that \"his weight, fairly applied, in conjunction with his skill, will enable him to answer all reasonable requirements.\" and also appeared twice for Dundee in the 1916–17 Scottish League, which did continue during the war.\n\nIn 1919, Rodgerson played three times for Hartlepools United in the Northern Victory League before returning to Huddersfield for the resumption of the Football League. He had a run of seven matches at left back early in the 1919–20 Football League season and made four more appearances later on, in each case covering for one or other of the regular backs, Fred Bullock and James Wood, as Huddersfield finished second in the table and were promoted to the First Division. The new season began in similar vein: with Wood injured, Rodgerson partnered Bullock in four matches, after which Huddersfield were top of the table, but as soon as Wood regained fitness Rodgerson lost his place. For much of the middle part of the season, Rodgerson was in the side, and he took his top-flight appearance total to 14. His last was on 12 February, and in March, he signed for Leeds United of the Second Division.\n\nAccording to the Yorkshire Evening Post, the transfer fee was undisclosed, but \"it may be assumed that ... it is at a much more moderate figure than the £1,500 which Town refused for Rodgerson's transfer last season.\" He was described as \"very sturdily built\", and despite \"a tendency to become reckless in his tackling when hard pressed, and to dribble the ball instead of getting rid of it ... his play improved markedly while he was regularly included in the league team.\" He played three times in what remained of the season, and began the 1921–22 season partnering Bert Duffield in the league side. Rodgerson continued in the team, either alongside Duffield or Jimmy Frew, until mid-February 1922 when manager Arthur Fairclough decided to pair Frew and Duffield.\n\nRodgerson was transfer-listed by Leeds at a fee of £250, and played Wearside League football for Sunderland West End before rejoining Dundee. Although he made a promising debut, the slowness initially attributed to an understandable lack of fitness failed to improve, his tackling lost its certainty, his clearances under pressure became panicky, and he lost his place. His performances picked up again, and he played seven matches in all for the first team, five in the League and two in the Scottish Cup. He returned to England and played for North-Eastern League clubs Spennymoor United and Carlisle United.\n\nRodgerson was married to Evelyn. A son, also named Ralph, played First Division football for Sunderland in the 1930s. In July 1939, the 46-year-old Rodgerson was working as a labourer for the Sunderland Gas Company when he collapsed and died while digging a trench. An inquest returned a verdict of death from natural causes, specifically heart disease.",

    "clean_text": "The future workshop is a futures technique developed by Robert Jungk, Ruediger Lutz and Norbert R. Muellert in the 1970s. It enables a group of people to develop new ideas or solutions of social problems. A future workshop is particularly suitable for participants who have little experience with processes of creative decision making, for example children or youth. However it is a useful method for any kind of complex problem that requires many stakeholders' involvement. The future workshop method requires an intensive preparation and support by trained moderators. It is used in spatial planning to involve citizens in the planning process,  in software engineering to create a common vision of the future, and in health care to solve complex and multifaceted problems. \n\nThe method is similar to Open Space Technology, Future Search, BarCamp or Unconferences.\n\nFuture workshop may also be used as a kind of action research method.\n\nPhases  \n Preparation phase: The method, its rules and the scheduled course of the workshop (in accordance with the participants) is introduced. \n Critique phase: The problem is investigated critically and thoroughly. First of all, a visualised brainstorming is performed and a general and critical question concerning the problem is framed. \n Fantasy or visionary phase: All participants try to work out a vision of the future, to draw a picture of future possibilities.\n Implementation phase: The ideas found are checked and evaluated with regard to their practicability. Discussions are related to the first step in order to achieve the vision.",

If no XML content model has been defined, the \"Schema\" tab can be used to generate XML schema or to generate DTD. XML editing views are synchronized, and can be switched between at any time simply by clicking the tabs at the bottom of the main editing window.\n\nText View \nThe XML text editor supports syntax coloring, code sensing, schema driven autocomplete and code folding.\n\nTree View \nTree View incrementally loads an XML file according to the nodes users expand, and allows analyzing and editing very large XML data files. Tree View is also specialized to handle document type definition (XML DTD) and XML schema.\n\nGrid View \nThe XML Grid View provides a  spreadsheet-like interface enabling more productive work with relational data or any XML document with repeating data structures, addressing a need that arises often when working with raw XML data in typical XML data integration applications.\n\nXML Schema Editor \nStylus Studio provides synchronized XML schema text editing and visual XML schema diagram views. Changes made to an XML schema in the text editor are  synchronized with the Diagram View, and vice versa. The schema editor includes an integrated XML schema documentation generator, to publish XML content models in HTML format.\n\nXSLT Visual Mapping Tool \nThe XSLT Mapper displays input documents on the left, and the target on the right. To map data, simply drag source nodes and drop them on the target, connecting the data sources to the desired data output. On the XSLT Source tab, the XSLT is displayed composed, based on the source-target relationship defined in the mapping operation. The code being generated is standard W3C XSLT and XPath code.\n\nXML Pipeline Designer \nStylus Studio provides a visual designer for creating XML pipelines in terms of a series of operations, for example, converting, validating, transforming, or performing other operations on an XML document. The XML Pipeline designer can automate many common tasks including Java code generation and debugging of XML processing applications.\n\nEDI to XML SEF Editor \nThe EDI to XML Conversion module helps convert EDI to XML and create custom EDI conversion definitions. It provides support for a variety of dialects including EDIFACT, HL7,  X12, HIPAA, IATA, AL3, EANCOM and NCPDP.\n\nHistory \nJune 8, 2001 Stylus Studio 3.0 was released. At the time it was primarily an XSLT IDE and the very first to feature an XSLT two-way editor and visual XML to XML mapping tool.\n\nJune 2002 Stylus Studio 2004 released a two way visual schema designer for XML Schema 1.0 and the first IDE to feature postmortem stack trace for XSLT with back mapping to the XSLT source. At that time it was the only XSLT debugger supporting cross-debugging between XSLT and Java extension functions.\n\nSeptember 2, 2003, Stylus Studio 5.0 introduced the very first XQuery two-way editor and visual XML to XML mapping tool. In addition this release introduced XSLT and XQuery profiler.\n\nOctober 4, 2004, Stylus Studio 6.0 added support for XSLT 2.0  a Grid View to its XML Editor and a new visual module called Convert To XML to convert flat file formats to XML.\n\nJune 13, 2006, Stylus Studio 2006 Release 3 bundled DataDirect XQuery 2.0 the first XQuery implementation over multiple relational database like  SQL Server, Oracle, DB2.\n\nSeptember 26, 2006, Stylus Studio 2007 introduced a visual designer and debugger for XML Pipeline and a graphical editor for building reports using XSLT or XQuery called Stylus Studio XML Publisher.\n\nDecember 11, 2007, Stylus Studio 2008 bundled DataDirect XML Converters for Java and .NET and added .NET code generation. Starting with this release converter engines are licensed separately from Stylus Studio.\n\nDecember 4, 2008 Stylus Studio 2009 added support for XQuery Update Facility 1.0.\n\nNovember 17, 2009 Stylus Studio 2010. The XQuery visual mapping tool added support for relational update. The XQuery text editor added code refactoring.\n\nNovember 10 2010 Stylus Studio 2011 added support for SQL update expressions to the XQuery Mapping tool and code refactoring to the XQuery editor.\n\nNovember 13, 2011 Stylus Studio X14, added support for XSLT 3.0 and XQuery 3.0 Working Draft 14 June 2011.\n\nJuly 23, 2012 Stylus Studio X14 Release 2, added new visual schema designer for Relax NG.\n\nDecember 3, 2012 Stylus Studio X15 added HTML WYSIWYG Designer, mapping automation with AutoLink and a new XSLT Editor auto-complete implementation.\n\nMay 7, 2014 Stylus Studio X15 Release 2, added support for executing and debugging XSLT 3.0 and XQuery 3.0 final and Apache FOP 1.1 was integrated.\n\nMay 17, 2016 Stylus Studio X16, added 64-bit version, SQL Editor, New Generic bi-directional Converter for fixed-width format, certified Windows 10 ready.",

It was created in 1810.Levey p.152\n\nHistory and description\nHe was the first diplomatic envoy sent to the country since the seventeenth century. He was well received by high society and attracted interest in the press. The painting was commissioned by Sir Gore Ouseley who had been appointed as the ambassador's guide during his stay on Britain.Holmes p.27 He had a distinguished career in the diplomatic service and returned again to England on another mission. In 1824 he was appointed Persia's first Minister of Foreign Affairs.\n\nthumb|Portrait of Mirza Abul Hasan by William Beechey, 1810\nLawrence, a future President of the Royal Academy, was a leading portraitist when he received the commission. He had a relatively short time-span to work due to the ambassador's imminent departure. Lawrence was unused to painting beards, as the Regency era fashion was for clean-shaven faces. He also had to portray the sitter's turban and ornamental dagger.Levey p.152 A full-length painting of the ambassador by William Beechey was also produced.Levey p.152\n\nToday the Lawrence portrait is part of the collection at Harvard Art Museums.https://harvardartmuseums.org/collections/object/299796",

    "clean_text": "William Stanley Humphries (born April 14, 1965) is an American former professional football player who was a quarterback in the National Football League (NFL) for the Washington Redskins and San Diego Chargers. He played college football for the Northeast Louisiana Indians and he was selected by the Redskins in the sixth round of the 1988 NFL draft.\n\nCollege career\nPlaying for Northeast Louisiana (now Louisiana–Monroe), Humphries was quarterback on the team that won the 1987 NCAA Division I-AA Football Championship Game. In two seasons, Humphries passed for 4,395 yards and 29 touchdowns. He still holds the record for 300-yard passing games with eight.\n\nProfessional career\n\n Washington \nHumphries was selected by the Redskins in the sixth round of the 1988 NFL draft. He made his first professional start in 1990 in Phoenix against the Cardinals with regular starter Mark Rypien sidelined with an injury. Humphries went on to pass for 1,015 yards and three touchdowns in seven games in 1990. The following season, he won a Super Bowl ring with the Redskins as Rypien's backup.\n\n San Diego \nHumphries was traded to the San Diego Chargers before the start of the 1992 season following a preseason injury to starting Chargers QB John Friesz. The two teams ran the same offense, allowing Humphries to quickly make an impact. He passed for 3,356 yards, which ranked fifth in the league in 1992. He helped lead the Chargers, who were 4–12 in 1991 and stumbled out to an 0–4 start in 1992, to finish with an 11–5 record that won the AFC West and ended the Chargers' decade-long playoff drought. To this day, the 1992 San Diego Chargers are the only NFL team to make the playoffs after an 0–4 start. He played with a separated left shoulder in the 1992 AFC Wild-Card Game, a 17–0 win over the Kansas City Chiefs, their first home playoff game since the 1980 AFC Championship game. Their season ended the next week in a 31–0 loss to the Miami Dolphins in the AFC Divisional Playoffs.\n\nIn 1994, Humphries led the Chargers with clutch performances through an impressive series of victories in the NFL Playoffs. It started with the Chargers rallying from a 21–6 halftime deficit at home to defeat the Miami Dolphins (led by Hall of Fame quarterback Dan Marino) with a 22–21 victory in the AFC divisional playoffs, earning the Chargers a trip to the AFC Championship Game the next week at Pittsburgh. The Pittsburgh Steelers were favored by 10 points, and some Steeler players the week prior to the game had made a Super Bowl rap video, assuming they would be the ones going to the Super Bowl. In what would become one of pro football's all-time great upsets, the Chargers again rallied from a 13–3 deficit late in the third quarter and held off a furious last-minute Pittsburgh drive with a goal-line stand to win the AFC championship 17–13 at Pittsburgh's Three Rivers Stadium. Thus the Chargers earned a trip to Miami and Super Bowl XXIX, the first and only Super Bowl appearance in franchise history. Humphries executed the first successful two-point conversion in the Super Bowl (which was adopted by the NFL at the start of the 1994 season), throwing a pass to Mark Seay. They were greeted by 70,000 fans at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium upon arriving back from Pittsburgh. Despite losing Super Bowl XXIX 49–26 to the San Francisco 49ers, more than 100,000 fans greeted the Chargers when they arrived back in San Diego after the game.\n\nIn 1997, Humphries was forced to retire after a series of concussions. During his career, he led the Chargers to three playoff appearances and the franchise's only Super Bowl appearance. Humphries started for San Diego from 1992 to 1997, making 81 starts in 88 games while completing 1,431 of 2,516 passes for 17,191 yards and 89 touchdowns. San Diego was 47–29 (62 percent) in regular-season games and 3–3 in playoff contests he started. He was inducted into the Chargers Hall of Fame in 2002. In 2009, he was one of four quarterbacks named on the franchise's 50th anniversary team. In 2004, Humphries was also inducted by the San Diego Hall of Champions into the Breitbard Hall of Fame honoring San Diego's finest athletes both on and off the playing surface. He was inducted into the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame in 2007.\n\nNFL career statistics\n Legend Led the league Bold Career high\n\nRegular season\n Year Team Games Passing Rushing Sacks                                      1989  WAS 2  0  0-0  5  10  50.0  91  9.1  39  1  1  75.4  5  10  2.0  9  0  3  9 1990  WAS 7  5  3-2  91  156  58.3  1,015  6.5  44  3  10  57.5  23  106  4.6  17  2  9  62 1992  SDG 16  15  11-4  263  454  57.9  3,356  7.4  67  16  18  76.4  28  79  2.8  25  4  28  218 1993  SDG 12  10  6-4  173  324  53.4  1,981  6.1  48  12  10  71.5  8  37  4.6  27  0  18  142 1994  SDG 15  15  11-4  264  453  58.3  3,209  7.1  99  17  12  81.6  19  19  1.0  8  0  25  223 1995  SDG 15  15  9-6  282  478  59.0  3,381  7.1  51  17  14  80.4  33  53  1.6  18  1  23  197 1996  SDG 13  13  7-6  232  416  55.8  2,670  6.4  63  18  13  76.7  21  28  1.3  7  0  20  187 1997  SDG 8  8  3-5  121  225  53.8  1,488  6.6  72  5  6  70.7  13  24  1.8  11  0  18  144 Career  88  81  50-31  1,431  2,516  56.9  17,191  6.8  99  89  84  75.8  150  356  2.4  27  7  144  1,182\n\nPlayoffs\n Year Team Games Passing Rushing Sacks                                      1992  SDG 2  2  1-1  32  67  47.8  339  5.1  44  0  4  38.1  2  10  5.0  10  0  6  57 1994  SDG 3  3  2-1  63  114  55.3  716  6.3  43  4  5  67.7  7  1  0.1  3  0  5  35 1995  SDG 1  1  0-1  23  47  48.9  292  6.2  26  2  4  47.5  4  32  8.0  17  0  1  8 Career  6  6  3-3  118  228  51.8  1,347  5.9  44  6  13  54.8  13  43  3.3  17  0  12  100\n\nPost-playing career \nHumphries became a college football commentator, and also hosts his namesake celebrity golf tournament, which has raised more than $1 million over the years for Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego.\n\nHumphries has served as the head girls basketball coach at Ouachita Christian School in Monroe, Louisiana since 2017.\n\n Golf \nHumphries has qualified for amateur golf's United States Senior Amateur Championship in 2022 and the R&A Senior Amateur Championship in 2023, finishing fourth in the latter.",

Upon his father's retirement from the stage, Scarpetta became the head of his theater company. He was one of the pioneers of Neapolitan and Italian cinema.\n\nBiography \nHis official debut took place at the Mercadante Theater in Naples on 7 January 1888, playing Peppeniello in the first performance of Miseria e Nobiltà, written by his father Eduardo for his debut.\n\nAt seventeen, he began writing his first comedies and in 1896 became a permanent member of his father's company, working with his step-siblings Titina, Eduardo, and Peppino De Filippo.\n\nIn the early 1910s his father Eduardo Scarpetta retired from the stage and he became the head of the company and lead actor. Upon his father's death (29 November 1925) he inherited the company and, while continuing to write and perform works following his father's repertoire, he also welcomed other authors such as Costagliola and Chiaruzzi, of whom he staged 'A femmena (1925) and L'agnello pasquale (1926), both based on Boccaccio. He also approached Luigi Chiarelli with Chello che simmo e chello che parimmo (1925) (adapted from La maschera e il volto) and Pirandello, as evidenced by the Neapolitan adaptation of Liolà (1931), later staged in 1935 by the De Filippo family.\n\nFilmography \n\n Actor \n\n Il suonatore di Chitarra (1910)\n Marito distratto e moglie manesca (1910)\n Tutto per mio fratello (1911)\n Il gallo nel pollaio (1916)\n Scarpetta e l'Americana (1916, released in 1918)\n Le nozze di Vittoria (1917)\n Scarpetta cerca moglie (1920, approximate year)\n Scarpetta vuol fumare (1920, approximate year)\n Gli ultimi giorni di Pompeo (1937)\n La dama bianca (1938)\n Eravamo sette vedove (1938)\n Miseria e nobiltà (1940, second film version)\n\n Director \n\n Marito distratto e moglie manesca (1910)\n Il suonatore di chitarra (1910)\n 'O tuono 'e marzo (1912)\n\n Writer \n\n Il gallo nel pollaio (1916)",

    "clean_text": "Scary Movie 2 is a 2001 American parody film directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans. It is the sequel to Scary Movie and the second installment in the Scary Movie film series. The film stars Anna Faris, Regina Hall, Shawn Wayans and Marlon Wayans (all reprising their roles from the first film, despite their characters having been killed), as well as Tim Curry, Tori Spelling, Chris Elliott, Chris Masterson, Kathleen Robertson, David Cross and James Woods. The film was the last in the series to feature the involvement of stars Marlon and Shawn Wayans, and director Keenen until the upcoming sixth installment. Marlon would eventually go on to produce a similar horror-themed parody, A Haunted House, and its sequel, both starring himself. In the latter film, Wayans pokes fun at the Scary Movie series' decline in quality after his family's departure.\n\nWhere the original film was mainly based on the slasher films of the 1990s, Scary Movie 2 parodies an array of supernatural and haunted house films from various decades, namely The Haunting (1999), Stigmata (1999), The Exorcist (1973), The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975), The Amityville Horror (1979), Poltergeist (1982), The Legend of Hell House (1973), House on Haunted Hill (both the 1959 and 1999 versions), The Changeling (1980), What Lies Beneath (2000) and Bloodbath at the House of Death (1984) while also making many references to the slasher flick I Still Know What You Did Last Summer (1998). It also spoofs the comedy film Dude, Where's My Car? (2000) and some contemporary films, such as Hannibal (2001), Hollow Man (2000) and Charlie's Angels (2000).\n\nScary Movie 2 was commercially successful, grossing $141.2 million worldwide from a $45 million budget, but received largely negative reviews from critics. A sequel was released in 2003, to slightly better reviews from critics.\n\nPlot \n \nAt the haunted mansion Hell House, teenager Megan Voorhees becomes possessed by the spirit of Hugh Kane, the house's cruel, wicked previous owner. She interrupts a formal dinner party, thrown by her mother, who seeks help from two priests, Fathers McFeely and Harris. After an unsuccessful attempt to exorcise Kane's ghost, McFeely pulls a gun and shoots Megan.\n\nOne year later, Cindy Campbell, Brenda Meeks, Ray Wilkins and Shorty Meeks are at college, trying to live new lives after surviving the events of the first film. Cindy and Brenda are tagged by socially maladjusted Alex. Shorty is still the same stoner he was before. Ray, still confused about his sexuality, has two new male friends, Tommy and Buddy, the latter of whom becomes romantically interested in Cindy. She rebuffs him but agrees to be friends.\n\nThe sinister Professor Oldman and his charming paraplegic assistant, Dwight Hartman, plan to study the paranormal activity at Hell House. They recruit Cindy and her friends as test subjects under the pretense of a psychological experiment on sleep paralysis. On her drive to the mansion, Cindy listens and sings badly along to \"Graduation\" by Vitamin C whom through the radio tells her to shut up. At the mansion, Cindy encounters a foul-mouthed parrot and Hanson, a creepy caretaker with a badly malformed hand. Later, the attractive Theo joins the group. They sit down for dinner but soon lose their appetite due to Hanson's repulsive handling of the food.\n\nThat night, Cindy hears voices directing her to a secret room, where she and Buddy discover Kane's wife's diary. Seeing her portrait, they note Cindy's (slight) resemblance. Meanwhile, the others also experience bizarre encounters. Kane's ghost has sex with Alex in her bedroom and quickly departs at the mention of commitment. Cindy gets into a fistfight with the house cat, Mr. Kittles. When Cindy tries to tell Oldman, he dismisses it and sends Theo to take Cindy to bed.\n\nLater, Cindy is possessed by Kane's wife, and she seduces Oldman. She quickly returns to normal, with no memory of the event. A toy clown attempts to kill Ray, but in a strange turn of events, the doll is molested by him instead. A weed-monster rolls Shorty into a joint and proceeds to smoke him (to his enjoyment), but gets distracted and lets him escape.\n\nThe next morning, Oldman tells Dwight that no one is leaving the house despite the attacks and shows his lecherous nature. Dwight is given the only house keys and told to give them to nobody. Theo offers oral sex to no avail; Dwight does it to himself. She knocks him out and takes the keys.\n\nOldman is seduced and killed by the ghost of Kane's mistress, Victoria Crane. Shorty later encounters Crane but charms and has sex with her. After Dwight equips the teens with weapons that can injure their spectral enemy, they are pursued throughout the mansion, Alex attempts to win Kane's love and searches for him, but is killed by Crane. Buddy and Cindy are locked in the walk-in freezer. Cindy uses a collection of random objects to produce a Caterpillar 2-Ton tractor and escapes the freezer. Hanson becomes possessed by Kane and kidnaps an inebriated Shorty. Cindy, Brenda, and Theo team up to battle him with highly stylized fight choreography but are defeated. Dwight regroups with the teens, and Cindy volunteers to act as bait to lure Kane into a device that will destroy him. The plan succeeds, freeing the group from the house's curse.\n\nTwo months later, Cindy and Buddy are in a relationship. They are out on a walk when Hanson appears to take her away with him. Buddy disappears as Hanson gets hit by a car driven by Shorty, who is receiving fellatio by Crane.\n\nCast \n\n Shawn Wayans as Ray Wilkins \n Marlon Wayans as Shorty Meeks \n Anna Faris as Cindy Campbell\n Regina Hall as Brenda Meeks\n Chris Masterson as Buddy Sanderson\n Kathleen Robertson as Theo\n David Cross as Dwight Hartman\n James Woods as Father McFeely\n Tim Curry as Professor Oldman\n Tori Spelling as Alex Monday\n Chris Elliott as Hanson\n Andy Richter as Father Harris\n Richard Moll as Hugh Kane (Hell House Ghost)\n Veronica Cartwright as Mrs. Voorhees\n James DeBello as Tommy\n Natasha Lyonne as Megan Voorhees\n Beetlejuice as Shorty's brain\n Matt Friedman (voice) as Polly the parrot \n Vitamin C (voice) as herself\n Suli McCullough (voice) as Clown\n Jennifer Curran as Victoria Crane, Hugh's mistress\n\nProduction \nThe film is a sequel to Scary Movie. According to director Keenen Ivory Wayans, the filmmakers watched over 130 horror films for background research. Marlon Brando was originally cast as Father McFeely and completed one day of filming before he had to leave the production due to illness. He was replaced by James Woods who was paid $1 million for four days work.\nCharlton Heston had also turned down the Woods role. At one point, former President Bill Clinton, who had just left office the year the film was released, was also considered.\n\nBecause Miramax had not greenlit the sequel until the massive box office success of the first, the film faced a punishing production schedule that involved coming up with a script and tearing through production and post-production in a total of less than nine months, roughly half the average time for all those steps to be completed on a standard Hollywood production in 2000–2001. It was this rushed production that made the Wayans never want to make another Scary Movie, and they were not involved in any of the sequels.\n\nMusic \nUnlike its predecessor, the film does not have an official soundtrack. It features a heavily hip hop and rap catalogue, with some rock and techno songs.\n\n \"Hello, Dolly!\" (Jerry Herman)\n \"Shake Ya Ass\" – Mystikal\n \"Tubular Bells\" – Mike Oldfield\n \"I Walk Alone\" – Oleander\n \"Killer Bee\" – Meeks\n \"If I Had No Loot\" – Tony!

In North America, the film grossed $71.3 million. With $69.9 million internationally, the worldwide gross comes to $141.2 million. Out of the first four Scary Movie films, this was the least successful to date, until the fifth film in 2013.\n\n Critical response \nOn Rotten Tomatoes, Scary Movie 2 has an approval rating of 13% based on 110 reviews and an average rating of 3.50/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Instead of being funny, this gross-out sequel plays like a sloppy, rushed-out product.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 29 out of 100 based on 25 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nAwards and nominations for Scary Movie 2\n Year Award Category Recipient(s) Result Ref. 2001 Bogey Awards Bronze Award    Teen Choice Awards Choice Movie of the Summer    Choice Movie Your Parents Didn’t Want You to See    2002 ALMA Awards Excellence in Make-Up in Television and Film Rebecca DeHerrera   Canadian Comedy Awards Best Female Performance Kathleen Robertson\n\nSequel \n\nA sequel titled Scary Movie 3, was released in 2003.",

Entered combat from England in March 1944 with fighter sweeps over the Bayeux-Saint-Aubin area of France. Participated in attacks on targets in France, Belgium, and Germany in preparation for the invasion of the Continent. Flew fighter sweeps over Normandy on 6 June 1944; targets included motor vehicle convoys, buildings, and gun emplacements. Moved to the Continent soon after D-Day. Received a DUC for three missions flown in support of ground forces on 11 July 1944: on a mission to destroy pillboxes near St. Lo, Normandy, France, discovered and destroyed portion of an enemy tank column unknown to Allied infantry; after rearming, the group returned to attack the tank column and prevented the enemy from accomplishing their mission. During the third mission, despite heavy rainfall, successfully attacked another Panzer battalion from minimum altitude. Group also supported Allied ground forces during the breakthrough at St. Lo in July 1944. In August 1944 attacked tanks, trucks, and troop concentrations as enemy retreated; provided armed reconnaissance for advancing Allied armored columns. During September 1944, attacked flak positions near Eindhoven during airborne landing in the Netherlands; bombed enemy communications and transportation lines in western Germany. Flew armed reconnaissance missions over Battle of the Bulge during December 1944 – January 1945; group flew 600 sorties from 17–27 December 1944 that resulted in the destruction of 43 enemy aircraft, 37 tanks, 328 trucks, 18 armored vehicles, four gun positions, and 15 half-tracks. Provided cover for VII Corps in January 1945 and during action destroyed over 1,000 enemy vehicles. Flew missions against enemy transportation systems including motor vehicles, bridges, trains, railway bridges, and marshalling yards during February and March 1945. Moved to Germany in April 1945. On group's last mission of the war, attacked harbors at Kiel and Flensbury on 3 May 1945. Served in occupational status in Germany from May 1945 until group inactivated.\n\n Cold War \nthumb|150px|left|Emblem of the 366th Fighter-Bomber Group\nThe group was activated on 1 January 1953 at Alexandria Air Force Base, Louisiana. It replaced the Federalized Iowa Air National Guard 132d Fighter Bomber Group which was being returned to state control after a twenty-one-month period of activation as a result of the Korean War. The group was composed of the 389th, 390th, and 391st Fighter Squadrons. Initially using the former ANG F-51D Mustangs, the 366th received F-86F Sabres which were returned from Korea in the summer of 1953, then received new swept-wing F-84F Thunderstreaks in early 1954. On 18 March 1954, the KB-29 equipped 420th Air Refueling Squadron was attached to the Wing to provide air refueling for the Thunderstreaks. The B-29s were later replaced with KB-50 aerial tankers.\n\nThe group's squadrons became first TAC units to perform six-month TDY rotations with NATO at Aviano AB, Italy, with rotations continuing until group inactivated in September 1957 when parent wing adopted Tri-Deputate organization and assigned operational squadrons directly to the wing.\n\n Modern era \nthumb|McDonnell Douglas F-15E-49-MC Strike Eagles 90-0233; 90-0246\nUpon activation in 1992, assumed control of 366th Wing's operational units. Deployed assets to Southwest Asia throughout the 1990s support to Operation SOUTHERN WATCH; elements participated in Operations PROVIDE COMFORT I and PROVIDE COMFORT II in Turkey. The group's squadrons directly participated in Operations Enduring Freedom and Noble Eagle following the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks.\n\nAfter the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the consolidation of the Air Force's KC-135 and B-1 force led to the reallocation of the unit's bombers and tankers to McConnell AFB, Kansas, and Ellsworth AFB, S.D.

In terms of sheer professionalism it was the finest piece of organisation and deployment of forces that the National Party has witnessed.\"\n\n SNP National Organiser \n\nHe served as National Organiser for the SNP from 1968 until his death in 1977. During this period, the SNP saw sustained growth, culminating in the return of 7 Westminster MPs in the 1974 General Election. Also notable during this time was Margo MacDonald's victory in the Govan by-election in 1973.\n\nThe job of National Organiser entailed driving all over Scotland to visit local party branches and he clocked up a huge annual mileage.\n\n Illness and death \nInitially misdiagnosed with lower back pain, he died of bladder cancer in a Glasgow hospital on 22 February 1977.",

    "clean_text": "The Heliodrom camp () or Heliodrom prison was a detention camp that operated between September 1992 and April 1994. It was run by the Military Police of the Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia to detain Bosniaks, Serbs, and other non-Croats and was located at a former military facility of the JNA in Rodoč, south of the town of Mostar.\n\nThe camp\nThe camp consisted of a sports hall and a three-story central prison building.  Conditions at the Heliodrom camp were inhumane, with severe overcrowding, inadequate medical and sanitary facilities, insufficient food and water, inadequate ventilation, and in the summer, suffocating heat. Detainees often slept on concrete floors with no bedding or blankets. On some occasions, HVO guards withheld all food and water from the detainees, in retaliation for HVO military setbacks.\n\nHerceg-Bosna/HVO forces regularly mistreated and abused, and allowed the mistreatment and abuse of, Bosniak detainees, both at the Heliodrom itself and at various locations where detainees were taken for forced labour or other purposes. There was regular cruel treatment and infliction of great suffering, with HVO soldiers and guards routinely beating detainees, often to the point of unconsciousness and severe injuries. Bosniak detainees lived in constant fear of physical and mental abuse. Bosniak detainees were often humiliated in various ways, including being forced to sing nationalistic Croatian songs. On 5 July 1993, HVO members fired indiscriminately at the building in which the detainees were being held. It is not known whether there were injuries.\n\nBosniak men were held and continued to be detained at the Heliodrom camp without any bona fide or adequate effort by the Herceg-Bosna/HVO authorities or forces to distinguish, classify or separate military prisoners from civilian detainees, or to provide for the release of civilian detainees.\n\nIn the Prlić et al. case, the Chamber found that several dozen detainees on forced labour were killed or wounded due to military confrontation while working on the front line. It also found that at least three Bosniak detainees were injured and four were killed while being used as human shields in combat. The Prosecution claimed in the indictment that at least fifty-four Bosniak detainees died as a result of being detained at this facilityHeliodrom and at least 178 were wounded on forced labor or as human shields.\n\nRecent developments\nJadranko Prlić, Bruno Stojić, Slobodan Praljak, Milivoj Petković, Valentin Corić, and Berislav Pušić were all charged with being part of a joint criminal enterprise from November 1991 to April 1994 to ethnically cleanse non-Croats from certain areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The indictment states that members of the enterprise (along with the HVO) set up and ran a network of prison camps, including the Heliodrom camp and Dretelj camp, to arrest, detain and imprison thousands of Bosniaks. Bosniaks in the camps were allegedly starved and subjected to \"physical and psychological abuse, including beatings and sexual assaults\".\n\nThe six accused were charged on the basis of both their individual and superior criminal responsibility under Articles 7(1) and 7(3) of the Statute respectively for:\n\n nine counts of grave breaches of the Geneva conventions (willful killing; inhuman treatment (sexual assault); unlawful deportation of a civilian; unlawful transfer of a civilian; unlawful confinement of a civilian; inhuman treatment (conditions of confinement); inhuman treatment; extensive destruction of property, not justified by military necessity and carried out unlawfully and wantonly; appropriation of property, not justified by military necessity and carried out unlawfully and wantonly).\n nine counts of violations of the laws or customs of war (cruel treatment (conditions of confinement); cruel treatment; unlawful labour; wanton destruction of cities, towns or villages, or destruction not justified by military necessity; destruction or willful damage done to institutions dedicated to religion or education; plunder of public or private property; unlawful attack on civilians; unlawful infliction of terror on civilians; cruel treatment), and\n eight counts of crimes against humanity (persecutions on political, racial and religious grounds; murder; rape; deportation; inhumane acts (forcible transfer); imprisonment; inhumane acts (conditions of confinement); inhumane acts).",

Muir attended Santa Monica College after being kicked out of school in the 10th grade.\n\nCareer\nMuir has cited bands such as the Sex Pistols, the Ramones, Black Sabbath, UFO, AC/DC, Van Halen, Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Led Zeppelin, and Kiss as his early musical influences, and has said that he was introduced to funk music by former bandmate Robert Trujillo. Muir incorporated funk influences into a few songs by Suicidal Tendencies and into his funk metal side project, Infectious Grooves.\n\nSuicidal Tendencies\n\nMuir formed Suicidal Tendencies in 1980 when he was 17 years old. It originally consisted of Muir on vocals, Mike Ball on guitar, Carlos \"Egie\" Egert on drums, and Mike Dunnigan on bass. There were several lineup changes before Muir hired Grant Estes, Louiche Mayorga and Amery Smith on guitar, bass and drums respectively. In 1983, they released their self-titled album, with success sparked by the anthem song \"Institutionalized\", which would become one of the first hardcore punk videos to receive substantial airplay on MTV. They have since played tours and festivals worldwide. When No Mercy guitarist Mike Clark was hired as the band's second guitarist in 1987, Suicidal Tendencies began making a change from punk to metal, thus creating what would become crossover thrash, and later began adding funk influences to their music. Robert Trujillo, who was the bassist for Suicidal Tendencies from 1989 to 1995, was responsible for turning Muir on to funk music, and the pair would eventually form Infectious Grooves to play more funk oriented music.\nthumb|upright=1.1|Muir (left) with Suicidal Tendencies in 2018\nCited as one of the most important crossover thrash groups, Suicidal Tendencies was active until 1995, but reunited a year later. Suicidal Tendencies has been touring or playing selected shows almost every year, and until the 2013 release of their ninth studio album 13, they had not released an album containing new music in over a decade. Between the releases of Free Your Soul and Save My Mind and 13, however, the band had debuted new material on stage and through compilation releases on a regular basis.\n\nLos Cycos\nMuir formed Los Cycos in 1984 during Suicidal's first year of their four-year recording hiatus. Current guitarist Jon Nelson left the group and Suicidal Tendencies were banned from playing L.A. shows, largely due to an incident at Perkins Palace where their audience tore out the first 10 rows, making it impossible for promoters to obtain insurance if Suicidal was on the bill. Muir started the label Suicidal Records with bassist Louiche Mayorga. Los Cycos originally consisted of Mike Muir (vocals), Bob Heathcote (bass), Anthony \"Bob\" Gallo (guitars) and Amery Smith (drums). After a few rehearsals, Amery Smith left the line up, along with bandmate Jon Nelson to start their own band (the Brood). Los Cycos eventually included: Grant Estes on lead guitar, Gallo went to (rhythm), and original choices Bob Heathcote and Amery Smith were replaced by Louiche Mayorga (bass) and No Mercy's Sal Troy (drums). Rehearsals continued in preparation for their debut recording for \"Welcome to Venice\" on Suicidal Records. With the final line-up established and two songs \"It's Not Easy\" and \"A Little Each Day\", Los Cycos was born. \"Welcome to Venice\" was the first record to be released on Suicidal Records, and the album also included local Venice, Los Angeles bands Suicidal Tendencies, Beowülf, No Mercy, and Excel. Unfortunately the original masters were lost in a fire and no effort has been made to release the material digitally. Mike Muir's vocals can be heard on the Suicidal Tendencies cut \"Look Up...(The Boys are Back)\" and the Los Cycos track \"It's Not Easy\". Grant Estes played all guitars on the recordings.\n\nOther music projects\nthumb|upright|Muir performing in 2008\nMuir has released solo albums under his nickname Cyco Miko and has sung for No Mercy, replacing original singer Kevin Guercio, who sang for the band on the Welcome to Venice compilation. Cyco Miko released three albums on the record label Suicidal Records. The album Schizophrenic Born Again Problem Child was released in 2001, following up 1996's Lost My Brain! (Once Again). In October 2011 a third Cyco Miko album was released worldwide, featuring previously unreleased and newly written music from Cyco Miko, Suicidal Tendencies and Infectious Grooves. The album entitled \"The Mad Mad Muir Musical Tour - Part 1\" featured current Suicidal Tendencies band members as well as performances by Fletcher Dragge, Robert Trujillo, Brooks Wackerman, bassist Thundercat (Stephen Bruner) and saxophonist Kamasi Washington. No Mercy released only one album with Muir, Widespread Bloodshed/Love Runs Red on Suicidal Records.\n\nIn 1989, not long after Robert Trujillo joined Suicidal Tendencies, Muir and Trujillo formed Infectious Grooves, a funk metal band that often brought out a goofier type of humor: their albums contain comedy skits by a reptilian lover named Aladdin Sarsippius Sulemenagic Jackson III. To date, the Infectious Grooves have released four albums.\n\nMuir executive produced Excel's 1987 debut album Split Image.\n\nMuir provided vocals on the P.O.D. song \"Kaliforn-Eye-A\" from their 2008 album When Angels & Serpents Dance.\n\nIn May 2021, Muir along with Tim Armstrong (Rancid), Matt Freeman (Rancid), Fletcher Dragge (Pennywise), and Byron McMacken (Pennywise) formed a punk rock supergroup called The Crew. The band's first single, \"One Voice\", was released on Epitaph Records.\n\nPersonal life\nIn 2003 Muir had his first of two back surgeries for a ruptured, herniated disc. The other, in 2005, caused him to cancel Brazilian festival dates and Suicidal shows.\n\nHis house was made over into a \"horror house\" on the Discovery Channel show Monster House.\n\nOn March 7, 1996, Muir fought Simon Woodstock in a celebrity boxing match on the Action Sports channel. Muir lost to Woodstock.\n\nMuir was a longtime friend to Texan film actor Bill Paxton. The two worked with each other for the LA Times in the late 1970s before Muir formed Suicidal Tendencies and Paxton started his career in Hollywood. Following Paxton's death in 2017, Muir expressed in a tribute his condolences to the late actor on Suicidal Tendencies' Facebook page.\n\nViews\n\nMuir is known for being outspoken on his views about the music industry and society. He has long been an opponent of the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC), and has reflected this in interviews and a few songs (namely \"You Can't Bring Me Down\" and \"Lovely\"). \n\nMuir was involved in a near-violent feud with Megadeth frontman Dave Mustaine during the European Clash of the Titans tour, but the two have since reconciled and are apparently now on friendly terms.\n\nMuir has criticized the band (and his band Suicidal Tendencies' former Epic Records labelmate) Rage Against the Machine, who are well known for expressing anti-corporate, left-wing politics in their lyrics. The Infectious Grooves song \"Do What I Tell Ya!\", from their album Groove Family Cyco, mocks the band for this contradiction. Muir later stated that Rage Against the Machine's guitarist, Tom Morello, provoked the feud by attacking Suicidal Tendencies.\n\nMuir has stated he has never used drugs and doesn't drink alcohol.\n\nSelected discography\nYearAlbum titleBandRecord labelCredits1983Suicidal TendenciesSuicidal TendenciesFrontierVocals1985Welcome to VeniceSuicidal Tendencies/Los CycosSuicidal RecordsVocals1987Split ImageExcelSuicidal Records/CarolineExecutive producer1987Widespread Bloodshed Love Runs RedNo MercySuicidal RecordsVocals, producer1987Join the ArmySuicidal TendenciesCarolineVocals1988How Will I Laugh Tomorrow When I Can't Even Smile TodaySuicidal TendenciesEpicVocals1989Controlled by Hatred/Feel Like Shit...Déjà VuSuicidal TendenciesEpicVocals1990Lights...Camera...Revolution!Suicidal TendenciesEpicVocals1991The Plague That Makes Your Booty Move...It's the Infectious GroovesInfectious GroovesEpicVocals1992The Art of RebellionSuicidal TendenciesEpicVocals1992F.N.G.Suicidal TendenciesEpicVocals1993Sarsippius' ArkInfectious GroovesEpicVocals1993Still Cyco After All These YearsSuicidal TendenciesEpicVocals1994Groove Family CycoInfectious GroovesEpicVocals1994Suicidal for LifeSuicidal TendenciesEpicVocals1996Lost My Brain!

    "title": "Juan d'Ors",
    "clean_text": "Juan d'Ors was born in Madrid, Spain, December 8, 1957. His grandfather was the philosopher and art critic Eugenio d'Ors. He is the son of Juan Pablo d'Ors Pérez, a humanist doctor, and María Luisa Fuhrer, a philologist. He is a singer, musician, actor, writer, film-maker, and \"Tintin\" expert (\"Tintinologist\").\n\nBiography \nIn April 1984, he published an ethic and aesthetic manifesto on Tintin´s style \"ligne claire\" (clear line), in the Madrilenian postmodernist magazine La Luna.Manifiesto del Nuevo Renacentismo, o qué diablos es eso de la Línea Clara, La Luna de Madrid, nº 6, Abril 1984, págs. 34 y 35; photos and quotes published in the exhibition catalogue La luna de Madrid y otras revistas de vanguardia de los años 80, National Library, Ministry of Culture, 2007 The text caused controversy and anticipated a new polemic emerging in October on the occasion of \"Tintin Imaginary Museum\", exhibition organized by Fundació Joan Miró in Barcelona.\"Cairo\" Magazines; from April to December 1984\n\nHis novels Belisa y el explorador de almas and No podrás ser feliz were both successively selected in the Premio Planeta de Novela (Planeta Prizes) last vote in 1984 and 1985. However they were never released. Most of d´ Ors abundant and continuous narrative work written between his childhood and marriage still remains unpublished.http://www.teinteresa.es/musica/Juan-polifacetico-escritor-presenta-trabajo_0_568143411.html. Magazine “El Invisible Anillo” nº 2, December 2006\n\nIn 1985, he started working as a voiceover actor. In 1988, he published his essay Tintin, Hergé... y los demás, which is considered today as a precursor text and one of the best written synthesis on the narrative and aesthetic work of the Belgian master. The book was reprinted in 1989.Juan Manuel Bonet, \"Tintín, Hergé y los demás\", Diario 16, May 1988\n\nIn 1990, he married Mónica Rabasa who gave birth to their only son, Jorge.\n\nIn 1991, he directed Spanish versions dubbing and took part as a singer and actor in series and films for several years.Duckman, Santo Bugito\n\nThe translation of the play Pour un oui ou pour un non by the French writer Nathalie Sarraute was published in 1994 and welcomed by specialized critics as Lorenzo López Sancho, in ABC. Being the first Spanish version of the text, an adapted Mexican version enriched with Juan d´Ors notes was known years later in that country.Publicaciones de la ADE, Madrid, 1994. Y Ediciones El Milagro, México DF, 2000. http://www.juandors.com/literatura_traducciones.html\n\nIn 1999, he separated from his wife.\n\nIn 2003, Juan d´Ors  established himself as a singer, overcoming his deceased father´s curse, who died in 1995, against his main vocation.\n\nProgressively, he became surrounded by the grand musicians needed in each occasion, depending on his own musical evolution: Olivier Chauzu, Adán Latonda, Gonzalo Rabasa, Jordi Pinyol, Albert Anguela, Félix Arribas, Daniel García, Costanzo Laini, Donato Goyeneche,Percussionist and composer. Author of the suites África and Noches de Marfil. Tomás Álvarez ... among others. Together they spread out all the sensibility and imagination necessary, they also used different types of promotion strategies.His 50th birthday: http://www.juandors.com/musica_tiempos_elementos.html\n\nFor two years, he fulfilled a giant musical work, producing, adapting and   transforming more than thirty songs assembled in two main blocks “Tiempos” and “Latidos”. Nearly at the same time he recorded more than forty instrumental pieces on his own voice – \"Tic – tac; bom – bom\" –, which he wishes to perform with a chamber orchestra.\n\nEven Juan d´Ors focuses his recent work as a singer, composer, arranger and producer, he never gives up his literary activity neither as an actor. He is almost always accompanied by a band of six multi-skilled and interchangeable musicians.\n\nHis current interests concentrate on videoclip: the first and second were made together with the producer Javier Cano, the third with the photographer Ignacio Cerezo and the fourth one, a jingle-soundtrack with the firm Posovisual. Also Juan d´Ors would like to contribute to the future creation of a permanent live cultural space in Spain.\n\nFrom a musical point of view, 2014 has been an important year for Juan d´Ors. In June he fulfilled 32 versions recordings of The Beatles at Galileo Galilei Concert Hall in Madrid. The works featured by a very pure sound, in acoustic and minimalist format, in the singer – songwriter style, paying special care to the dynamics. Together with Diana Valencia, Daniel Saavedra, Javier Simón and William Carreazo, the video can be watched in two parts in its own video channel. In September, Flamenco making – of and videoclip are published. His fifth work being a personal tribute to the 50th anniversary of Los Brincos. It was filmed in Cádiz, with Urban Sketchers from different groups. The film has its own official web in Facebook and soon it will take part at Musiclip festival (Barcelona/Bogotá) contest in 2015.\n\nWorks \n\n Music \n\nDiscography /Records:\n Trovadores de silencios (Book / Record.

McDaniel, Sr. was born July 7, 1916, in Martinsville, Virginia, to Charlie and Mary Earley McDaniel.\n\nHe attended both Lucy Addison High School in Roanoke, Virginia, and the Piedmont Christian Institute (high school).The Roanoke Times. \"4 Tuskegee Airmen were Lucy Addison High School grads.\" Feb 18, 2012. https://roanoke.com/archive/4-tuskegee-airmen-were-lucy-addison-high-school-grads/article_059e6a73-032a-57b9-ba6d-22976bd39cda.htmlAfroVirginia. \"Piedmont Christian Institute.\" http://places.afrovirginia.org/items/show/338 \n\nHe attended Virginia State University, graduating with a B.S. in business administration. He also graduated from Temple University with a P.A. in economics, and received his teacher qualification from Rider College in Princeton, New Jersey.\n\nHe returned to Martinsville, Virginia, to teach English, history and social science at an all African-American high school until the beginning of World War II.\n\nMilitary service\nMcDaniel attended flight training at Tuskegee Army Airfield in Tuskegee, Alabama, as a member of its Class 43-A-SE, one of the first flight classes at the airfield. After completing training on January 14, 1943, he was deployed to Italy in December 1943 as a member of the all-African American 332nd Fighter Group's 301st Fighter Squadron,  best known as the \"Tuskegee Airmen.\"  The squadron's mission was to provide air cover for Allied ships using Naples harbor and escort Allied bombers into Germany's strategic targets.\n\nOn March 24, 1945, Col. Benjamin O. Davis Jr. led 332nd Fighter Group pilots on a  bomber escort mission from the Foggia Airfield Complex's Ramitelli AirField in Italy to protect Fifteenth Air Force bombers on a mission to attack a tank assembly plant in Berlin, Germany.  When fighters scheduled to take over escort duties failed to show up and Davis's plane began to suffer engine problems, requiring him to head back to Ramitelli, McDaniel, now a captain, assumed command from Davis, leading the pilots to Berlin despite their P-51 aircraft running low on fuel. As they neared Berlin, he and his pilots were attacked by 25 German Me 262 fighter jets. They downed three German jets, suffering no losses to their U.S. bomber fleet. Nonetheless, the Germans shot down and captured McDaniel and another P-51 pilot. As McDaniel leaped from his aircraft, he fractured both legs.\n\nThe Germans initially imprisoned McDaniel at Nuremberg, Germany, Munich, Germany, and ultimately at Stalag VII-A near Moosburg, Germany, for over 30 days. He was eventually liberated by General George Patton's US Third Army on April 29, 1945.\n\nIn January 1945, McDaniel became the 301st Fighter Squadron's commanding officer, replacing Major Lee Rayford, who returned to the United States. In 1946, McDaniel became the commandant of cadets at the Tuskegee Army Air Field. McDaniel was later stationed in Alaska, where he led several units.\n\nIn 1964, McDaniel retired from the active duty Air Force as a lieutenant colonel. He later worked for the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare in New York City as a civil rights specialist.\n\nFamily\nAfter World War II, McDaniel married Faye J. Wilson McDaniel (1935–2019) of Fayetteville, Tennessee. McDaniel had three children: Armour G. McDaniel, Jr. (1952–1989), Gregory McDaniel and Gwendolyn Jackson. He also had four step-children: Delmer Jerome Edmonds, Jr., Kevin L. Edmonds, Donald E. Edmonds and Regina F. Majors.\n\nDeath, interments\nMcDaniel died on November 12, 1989, in Indianapolis, Indiana. He is interred at Arlington National Cemetery in Section 65, Grave 2822. His wife, Faye, is buried alongside him in Arlington.\n\nLegacy\n\n McDaniel's widow, Faye J. Wilson McDaniel (1935–2019), attended the 2016 ribbon-cutting ceremonies celebrating the renaming of a section of Interstate 65 near Columbus, Indiana, for the Tuskegee Airmen. Surrounded by members of the U.S. military and government officials, Mrs. McDaniel cut the ribbon.\n In February 2019, Virginia State Senator Bill Stanley (politician) (R-Franklin County) honored the memory of McDaniels by presenting a flag to McDaniel's Martinsville-based cousin, placing a framed photograph of a wreath on McDaniel's grave at Arlington National Cemetery, and flying a flag over the Virginia state capital in his honor.  A photograph capturing one of McDaniel's missions is displayed at the Smithsonian's National Aerospace Museum. The photograph shows a damaged wing on McDaniel's plane after he led an attack on German barges on the Danube River in 1944. McDaniel personally destroyed six barges, each containing approximately 250 troops. Despite damage to his plane, McDaniel successfully returned to base.",

    "clean_text": "Hamilton Senior High School was a public co-educational high day school on Purvis Street in Hamilton Hill, a suburb of Perth, Western Australia. The school was often referred to as Hamilton Hill Senior High School, and educated students in Year 7 to Year 12 from its establishment in 1962 until its closure on .\n\nOverview \nAfter opening in 1962, an enrolment of 1350 students was reached by 1971. The large enrolment numbers and other factors led to the introduction of the \"sub-school\" system at Hamilton Senior High School from 1975, consisting of three lower-school sub-schools—Delta, Grinceri (later renamed Leda), and Omega—each containing students from years 8 to 10, with students in years 11 and 12 in a separate upper school.\n\nThe school enrolled 696 students in 2007, 675 in 2008, 711 in 2009, then fell to 622 in 2010 and to 580 in 2011. The fall in student numbers from 2010 is a result of the enrolment age changing for students entering high school in Western Australia.\n\nOn 12 December 1962 a worker, Velko Garbin, suffered fatal injuries sustained by a nail gun incident during the construction of the school. A plaque honouring him was placed in the entry of the school library.\n\nThe school suffered an arson attack in 2010 when a metal shed was set alight, causing A$100,000 in damage.\n\nPlans to close the school and merge students with South Fremantle Senior High School as a new school were announced in December 2014. The larger number of students would allow for more opportunities and subjects for students. The school was closed permanently at the end of the 2017 school year. From 2018, Hamilton Senior High School students joined students of the also-defunct South Fremantle Senior High School to form Fremantle College.\n\nThe buildings of the former Hamilton Senior High School were earmarked for demolition and the land designated for housing.",

    "title": "Church architecture",
    "clean_text": "Church architecture refers to the architecture of Christian buildings, such as churches, chapels, convents, and seminaries. It has evolved over the two thousand years of the Christian religion, partly by innovation and partly by borrowing other architectural styles as well as responding to changing beliefs, practices and local traditions. From the Early Christianity to the present, the most significant objects of transformation for Christian architecture and design were the great churches of Byzantium, the Romanesque abbey churches, Gothic cathedrals and Renaissance basilicas with its emphasis on harmony. These large, often ornate and architecturally prestigious buildings were dominant features of the towns and countryside in which they stood. However, far more numerous were the parish churches in Christendom, the focus of Christian devotion in every town and village. While a few are counted as sublime works of architecture to equal the great cathedrals and churches, the majority developed along simpler lines, showing great regional diversity and often demonstrating local vernacular technology and decoration.\n\nBuildings were at first from those originally intended for other purposes but, with the rise of distinctively ecclesiastical architecture, church buildings came to influence secular ones which have often imitated religious architecture. In the 20th century, the use of new materials, such as steel and concrete, has had an effect upon the design of churches. \n\nThe history of church architecture divides itself into periods, and into countries or regions and by religious affiliation. The matter is complicated by the fact that buildings put up for one purpose may have been re-used for another, that new building techniques may permit changes in style and size, that changes in liturgical practice may result in the alteration of existing buildings and that a building built by one religious group may be used by a successor group with different purposes.\n\nOrigins and development of the church building \nThe simplest church building comprises a single meeting space, built of locally available material and using the same skills of construction as the local domestic buildings. Such churches are generally rectangular, but in African countries where circular dwellings are the norm, vernacular churches may be circular as well. A simple church may be built of mud brick, wattle and daub, split logs or rubble. It may be roofed with thatch, shingles, corrugated iron or banana leaves. However, church congregations, from the 4th century onwards, have sought to construct church buildings that were both permanent and aesthetically pleasing. This had led to a tradition in which congregations and local leaders have invested time, money and personal prestige into the building and decoration of churches.\n\nWithin any parish, the local church is often the oldest building and is larger than any pre-19th-century structure except perhaps a barn. The church is often built of the most durable material available, often dressed stone or brick. The requirements of liturgy have generally demanded that the church should extend beyond a single meeting room to two main spaces, one for the congregation and one in which the priest performs the rituals of the Mass. To the two-room structure is often added  aisles, a tower, chapels, and vestries and sometimes transepts and mortuary chapels. The additional chambers may be part of the original plan, but in the case of a great many old churches, the building has been extended piecemeal, its various parts testifying to its long architectural history.\n\nBeginnings\n\nIn the first three centuries of the Early Livia Christian Church, the practice of Christianity was illegal and few churches were constructed. In the beginning, Christians worshipped along with Jews in synagogues and in private houses. After the separation of Jews and Christians, the latter continued to worship in people's houses, known as house churches. These were often the homes of the wealthier members of the faith. Saint Paul, in his first letter to the Corinthians writes: \"The churches of Asia send greetings. Aquila and Prisca, together with the church in their house, greet you warmly in the Lord.\"\n\nSome domestic buildings were adapted to function as churches. One of the earliest of adapted residences is at Dura Europos church, built shortly after 200 AD, where two rooms were made into one, by removing a wall, and a dais was set up. To the right of the entrance a small room was made into a baptistry.\n\nSome church buildings were specifically built as church assemblies, such as that opposite the emperor Diocletian's palace in Nicomedia. Its destruction was recorded thus:\nWhen that day dawned, in the eighth consulship of Diocletian and seventh of Maximian, suddenly, while it was yet hardly light, the prefect, together with chief commanders, tribunes, and officers of the treasury, came to the church in Nicomedia, and the gates having been forced open, they searched everywhere for an idol of the Divinity. The books of the Holy Scriptures were found, and they were committed to the flames; the utensils and furniture of the church were abandoned to pillage: all was rapine, confusion, tumult. That church, situated on rising ground, was within view of the palace; and Diocletian and Galerius stood as if on a watchtower, disputing long whether it ought to be set on fire. The sentiment of Diocletian prevailed, who dreaded lest, so great a fire being once kindled, some part of the city might he burnt; for there were many and large buildings that surrounded the church. Then the Pretorian Guards came in battle array, with axes and other iron instruments, and having been let loose everywhere, they in a few hours leveled that very lofty edifice with the ground.\n\nFrom house church to church\nFrom the first to the early fourth centuries most Christian communities worshipped in private homes, often secretly. Some Roman churches, such as the Basilica of San Clemente in Rome, are built directly over the houses where early Christians worshipped. Other early Roman churches are built on the sites of Christian martyrdom or at the entrance to catacombs where Christians were buried.\n\nthumb|Saint Peter's church, Vienne, France, built at the end of the 5th century as an episcopal burial church in the form of an ancient basilica\nWith the victory of the Roman emperor Constantine at the Battle of Milvian Bridge in 312 AD, Christianity became a lawful and then the privileged religion of the Roman Empire. The faith, already spread around the Mediterranean, now expressed itself in buildings. Christian architecture was designed to correspond to the civic and imperial forms of ancient Roman architecture, because the architects and building craftsmen mastered these forms. The Aula regia, the typical audience hall of imperial palaces with a throne apse, became the model for aisleless churches (later developed into hall churches), whereas the Basilica building type, with a higher central nave flanked by two or more lower longitudinal aisles, commonly used for market halls in the Roman era, became the most widespread building type for churches in the East and West, sometimes with galleries and clerestories. While civic basilicas mostly had no apses, or sometimes apses at either end, the Christian basilica usually had a single apse (like the aula regia) where the bishop and presbyters sat in a dais behind the altar. While pagan basilicas had as their focus a statue of the emperor, Christian basilicas focused on the altar as place of the Eucharist. Central buildings, often modeled on Roman official buildings, with circular (rotunda - like the Pantheon, Rome), oval, square, cruciform, hexagonal, octagonal, nonagonal or higher polygonal building shapes, also served as models, for example for the 6th century Basilica of San Vitale in Ravenna. The Roman temple, on the other hand, was only suitable as a design for smaller chapels, as it only had a small cella inside, to which only the priests had access, but not the congregation, as in Christian churches.\n\nThe first very large Christian churches were built in Rome in the early 4th century: Old St. Peter's Basilica, Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls, San Giovanni in Laterano, Santa Maria Maggiore, and in the early 5th century Santa Sabina (which of Rome's ancient churches has most faithfully preserved its original appearance). \n\nIn Ravenna, the temporary ruler's residence shortly before and after the fall of the Roman Empire (476), many early Christian churches were not only newly built but have also been preserved to this day: In the 5th century the Mausoleum of Galla Placidia and the Baptistery of Neon were built and in the 6th century the Basilica of Sant'Apollinare Nuovo, Basilica of Sant'Apollinare in Classe, Basilica of San Vitale, the Arian Baptistery and the Archbishop's Chapel.\n\nIn addition to such new church buildings, a number of ancient temples or civil buildings were later converted into churches, especially after the fall of the Roman Empire, for instance the Pantheon, Rome, the Temple of Antoninus and Faustina, Rome, Sant'Adriano al Foro, Rome (the former Curia Julia), the Mausoleum of Constantina, Rome, Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri (the former frigidarium and tepidarium of the Baths of Diocletian), Santa Croce in Gerusalemme, Rome (a former Imperial aula), Santa Balbina, Rome (the hall of a private palace of Lucius Fabius Cilo), the Cathedral of Syracuse (a Greek temple), the Temple of Minerva, Assisi, the Maison carrée in Nîmes, France (a former temple), the Baptistère Saint-Jean in Poitiers, France (a former civil building). \n\nThe early churches distinguished themselves from pagan temples by the simplicity in their execution; a lot of brickwork and little marble, no plastic arts, no “moving” scenes. The glass mosaics were suggestive (poster function) but made of comparatively cheap material. Depictions of saints like those in Ravenna were deliberately not lifelike, but rather “disembodied”. The outer walls were only lightened up by the partially large windows. It was only later that the upper part of the facade was decorated with mosaics. In much later eras were these basilicas more richly decorated, with magnificent Renaissance ceilings and marble walls, pompous statues and stucco, such as the still standing Roman ones, Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls, San Giovanni in Laterano, Santa Maria Maggiore. The Ravenna Basilica of Sant'Apollinare in Classe still gives a relatively authentic impression, with the original columns, mosaics and the open beamed ceiling as well as the exterior.\n\nCharacteristics of the early Christian church building\nthumb|350px|Plan of Old St Peter's Basilica, showing atrium (courtyard), narthex (vestibule), central nave with double aisles, a bema for the clergy extending into a transept, and an exedra or semi-circular apse.\nThe church building as we know it grew out of a number of features of the Ancient Roman period:\n The house church\n The atrium\n The basilica\n The bema\n The mausoleum: centrally planned building\n The cruciform ground plan: Latin or Greek cross\n\nAtrium\nWhen early Christian communities began to build churches they drew on one particular feature of the houses that preceded them, the atrium, or courtyard with a colonnade surrounding it. Most of these atriums have disappeared. A fine example remains at the Basilica of San Clemente in Rome and another was built in the Romanesque period at Sant'Ambrogio, Milan. The descendants of these atria may be seen in the large square cloisters that can be found beside many cathedrals, and in the huge colonnaded squares or piazza at the Basilicas of St Peter's in Rome and St Mark's in Venice and the Camposanto (Holy Field) at the Cathedral of Pisa.\n\nBasilica\nEarly church architecture did not draw its form from Roman temples, as they did not have large internal spaces where worshipping congregations could meet. It was the Roman basilica used for meetings, markets, and courts of law that provided a model for the large Christian church and that gave its name to the Christian basilica.\n\nBoth Roman basilicas and Roman bath houses had at their core a large vaulted building with a high roof, braced on either side by a series of lower chambers or a wide arcaded passage. An important feature of the Roman basilica was that at either end it had a projecting exedra, or apse, a semicircular space roofed with a half-dome. This was where the magistrates sat to hold court. It passed into the church architecture of the Roman world and was adapted in different ways as a feature of cathedral architecture.\n\nThe earliest large churches, such as the Cathedral of San Giovanni in Laterano in Rome, consisted of a single-ended basilica with one apsidal end and a courtyard, or atrium, at the other end. As Christian liturgy developed, processions became part of the proceedings. The processional door was that which led from the furthest end of the building, while the door most used by the public might be that central to one side of the building, as in a basilica of law. This is the case in many cathedrals and churches.\n\nBema\nAs numbers of clergy increased, the small apse which contained the altar, or table upon which the sacramental bread and wine were offered in the rite of Holy Communion, was not sufficient to accommodate them. A raised dais called a bema, a concept taken from synagogue architecture, formed part of many large basilican churches. In the case of St. Peter's Basilica and San Paolo Fuori le Mura (St Paul's outside the Walls) in Rome, this bema extended laterally beyond the main meeting hall, forming two arms so that the building took on the shape of a T with a projecting apse. From this beginning, the plan of the church developed into the so-called Latin Cross which is the shape of most Western Cathedrals and large churches. The arms of the cross are called the transept.Fletcher, Banister. A History of Architecture\n\nMausoleum\nOne of the influences on church architecture was the mausoleum. The mausoleum of a noble Roman was a square or circular domed structure which housed a sarcophagus. The Emperor Constantine built for his daughter Costanza a mausoleum which has a circular central space surrounded by a lower ambulatory or passageway separated by a colonnade.\nSanta Costanza's burial place became a place of worship as well as a tomb. It is one of the earliest church buildings that was central, rather than longitudinally planned. Constantine was also responsible for the building of the circular, mausoleum-like Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, which in turn influenced the plan of a number of buildings, including that constructed in Rome to house the remains of the proto-martyr Stephen, San Stefano Rotondo and the Basilica of San Vitale in Ravenna.\n\nAncient circular or polygonal churches are comparatively rare. A small number, such as the Temple Church, London were built during the Crusades in imitation of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre as isolated examples in England, France, and Spain. In Denmark such churches in the Romanesque style are much more numerous. In parts of Eastern Europe, there are also round tower-like churches of the Romanesque period but they are generally vernacular architecture and of small scale. Others, like St Martin's Rotunda at Visegrad, in the Czech Republic, are finely detailed.\n\nThe circular or polygonal form lent itself to those buildings within church complexes that perform a function in which it is desirable for people to stand, or sit around, with a centralized focus, rather than an axial one. In Italy, the circular or polygonal form was used throughout the medieval period for baptisteries, while in England it was adapted for chapter houses. In France, the aisled polygonal plan was adopted as the eastern terminal and in Spain, the same form is often used as a chapel.\n\nOther than Santa Costanza and San Stefano, there was another significant place of worship in Rome that was also circular, the vast Ancient Roman Pantheon, with its numerous statue-filled niches. This too was to become a Christian church and lend its style to the development of Cathedral architecture.\n\nLatin cross and Greek cross\nMost cathedrals and great churches have a cruciform groundplan. In churches of Western European tradition, the plan is usually longitudinal, in the form of the so-called Latin Cross, with a long nave crossed by a transept. The transept may be as strongly projecting as at York Minster or not project beyond the aisles as at Amiens Cathedral.\n\nMany of the earliest churches of Byzantium have a longitudinal plan. At Hagia Sophia, Istanbul, there is a central dome, the frame on one axis by two high semi-domes and on the other by low rectangular transept arms, the overall plan being square. This large church was to influence the building of many later churches, even into the 21st century. A square plan in which the nave, chancel and transept arms are of equal length forming a Greek cross, the crossing generally surmounted by a dome became the common form in the Eastern Orthodox Church, with many churches throughout Eastern Europe and Russia being built in this way. Churches of the Greek Cross form often have a narthex or vestibule which stretches across the front of the church. This type of plan was also to later play a part in the development of church architecture in Western Europe, most notably in Bramante's plan for St. Peter's Basilica.\n\nDivergence of Eastern and Western church architecture\nThe division of the Roman Empire in the fourth century AD, resulted in Christian ritual evolving in distinctly different ways in the eastern and western parts of the empire. The final break was the Great Schism of 1054.\n\nEastern Orthodoxy and Byzantine architecture\nright|thumb|280px|An illustrated layout of the traditional interior of an Orthodox Church\n\nEastern Christianity and Western Christianity began to diverge from each other from an early date. Whereas the basilica was the most common form in the west, a more compact centralized style became predominant in the east. These churches were in origin martyria, constructed as mausoleums housing the tombs of the saints who had died during the persecutions which only fully ended with the conversion of Emperor Constantine. An important surviving example is the Mausoleum of Galla Placidia in Ravenna, which has retained its mosaic decorations. Dating from the 5th century, it may have been briefly used as an oratory before it became a mausoleum.\n\nThese buildings copied pagan tombs and were square, cruciform with shallow projecting arms or polygonal. They were roofed by domes which came to symbolize heaven. The projecting arms were sometimes roofed with domes or semi-domes that were lower and abutted the central block of the building. Byzantine churches, although centrally planned around a domed space, generally maintained a definite axis towards the apsidal chancel which generally extended further than the other apses. This projection allowed for the erection of an iconostasis, a screen on which icons are hung and which conceals the altar from the worshippers except at those points in the liturgy when its doors are opened.\nthumb|upright=0.9|Coptic cruciform church in Dongola, ninth century\nThe architecture of Constantinople (Istanbul) in the 6th century produced churches that effectively combined centralized and basilica plans, having semi-domes forming the axis, and arcaded galleries on either side. The church of Hagia Sophia (now a mosque) was the most significant example and had an enormous influence on both later Christian and Islamic architecture, such as the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem and the Umayyad Great Mosque in Damascus. Many later Eastern Orthodox churches, particularly large ones, combine a centrally planned, domed eastern end with an aisled nave at the west.\n\nA variant form of the centralized church was developed in Russia and came to prominence in the sixteenth century. Here the dome was replaced by a much thinner and taller hipped or conical roof which perhaps originated from the need to prevent snow from remaining on roofs. One of the finest examples of these tented churches is St. Basil's in Red Square in Moscow.\n\n Medieval West \nthumb|West elevation of the Cathedral of Notre-Dame de Chartres\nthumb|left|Strasbourg Cathedral west front\n\nParticipation in worship, which gave rise to the porch church, began to decline as the church became increasingly clericalized; with the rise of the monasteries church buildings changed as well. The 'two-room' church' became, in Europe, the norm. The first 'room', the nave, was used by the congregation; the second 'room', the sanctuary, was the preserve of the clergy and was where the Mass was celebrated. This could then only be seen from a distance by the congregation through the arch between the rooms (from late mediaeval times closed by a wooden partition, the Rood screen), and the elevation of the host, the bread of the communion, became the focus of the celebration: it was not at that time generally partaken of by the congregation. Given that the liturgy was said in Latin, the people contented themselves with their own private devotions until this point. Because of the difficulty of sight lines, some churches had holes, 'squints', cut strategically in walls and screens, through which the elevation could be seen from the nave. Again, from the twin principles that every priest must say his mass every day and that an altar could only be used once, in religious communities a number of altars were required for which space had to be found, at least within monastic churches.\n\nApart from changes in the liturgy, the other major influence on church architecture was in the use of new materials and the development of new techniques. In northern Europe, early churches were often built of wood, for which reason almost none survive. With the wider use of stone by the Benedictine monks, in the tenth and eleventh centuries, larger structures were erected.\n\nThe two-room church, particularly if it were an abbey or a cathedral, might acquire transepts. These were effectively arms of the cross which now made up the ground plan of the building. The buildings became more clearly symbolic of what they were intended for. Sometimes this crossing, now the central focus of the church, would be surmounted by its own tower, in addition to the west end towers, or instead of them. (Such precarious structures were known to collapse – as at Ely – and had to be rebuilt.) Sanctuaries, now providing for the singing of the offices by monks or canons, grew longer and became chancels, separated from the nave by a screen. Practical function and symbolism were both at work in the process of development.\n\nFactors affecting the architecture of churches\nthumb|left|Ceiling of the Sistine Chapel with Christian Mosaics feature prominently.\nthumb|right|Sacred Heart Cathedral of Algiers, Algiers (1963)\n\nAcross Europe, the process by which church architecture developed and individual churches were designed and built was different in different regions, and sometimes differed from church to church in the same region and within the same historic period.\n\nAmong the factors that determined how a church was designed and built are the nature of the local community, the location in city, town or village, whether the church was an abbey church, whether the church was a collegiate church, whether the church had the patronage of a bishop, whether the church had the ongoing patronage of a wealthy family and whether the church contained relics of a saint or other holy objects that were likely to draw pilgrimage.\n\nCollegiate churches and abbey churches, even those serving small religious communities, generally demonstrate a greater complexity of form than parochial churches in the same area and of a similar date.\n\nChurches that have been built under the patronage of a bishop have generally employed a competent church architect and demonstrate in the design refinement of style unlike that of the parochial builder.\n\nMany parochial churches have had the patronage of wealthy local families. The degree to which this has an effect on the architecture can differ greatly. It may entail the design and construction of the entire building having been financed and influenced by a particular patron. On the other hand, the evidence of patronage may be apparent only in accretion of chantry chapels, tombs, memorials, fittings, stained glass, and other decorations.\n\nChurches that contain famous relics or objects of veneration and have thus become pilgrimage churches are often very large and have been elevated to the status of basilica. However, many other churches enshrine the bodies or are associated with the lives of particular saints without having attracted continuing pilgrimage and the financial benefit that it brought.\n\nThe popularity of saints, the veneration of their relics, and the size and importance of the church built to honor them are without consistency and can be dependent upon entirely different factors. Two virtually unknown warrior saints, San Giovanni and San Paolo, are honoured by one of the largest churches in Venice, built by the Dominican Friars in competition to the Franciscans who were building the Frari Church at the same time. The much smaller church that contained the body of Saint Lucy, a martyr venerated by Catholics and Protestants across the world and the titular saint of numerous locations, was demolished in the late 19th century to make way for Venice's railway station.\n\nThe first truly baroque façade was built in Rome between 1568 and 1584 for the Church of the Gesù, the mother church of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits). It introduced the baroque style into architecture. Corresponding with the Society's theological task as the spearhead of the Counter-Reformation, the new style soon became a triumphant feature in Catholic church architecture.\n\nAfter the second world war, modern materials and techniques such as concrete and metal panels were introduced in Norwegian church construction. Bodø Cathedral for instance was built in reinforced concrete allowing a wide basilica to be built. During the 1960s there was a more pronounced break from tradition as in the Arctic Cathedral built in lightweight concrete and covered in aluminum sidings.\n\nWooden churches\n\nthumb|Borgund stave church, Norway, late 12th century\nthumb|Old Olden Church, a 1759 log building\nIn Norway, church architecture has been affected by wood as the preferred material, particularly in sparsely populated areas. Churches built until the second world war are about 90% wooden except medieval constructions. During the Middle Ages all wooden churches in Norway (about 1000 in total) were constructed in the stave church technique, but only 271 masonry constructions. After the Protestant reformation when the construction of new (or replacement of old) churches was resumed, wood was still the dominant material but the log technique became dominant. The log construction gave a lower more sturdy style of building compared to the light and often tall stave churches. Log construction became structurally unstable for long and tall walls, particularly if cut through by tall windows. Adding transepts improved the stability of the log technique and is one reason why the cruciform floor plan was widely used during 1600 and 1700s. For instance the Old Olden Church (1759) replaced a building damaged by hurricane, the 1759 church was then constructed in cruciform shape to make it withstand the strongest winds. The length of trees (logs) also determined the length of walls according to Sæther. In Samnanger church for instance, outside corners have been cut to avoid splicing logs, the result is an octagonal floor plan rather than rectangular. The cruciform constructions provided a more rigid structure and larger churches, but view to the pulpit and altar was obstructed by interior corners for seats in the transept. The octagonal floor plan offers good visibility as well as a rigid structure allowing a relatively wide nave to be constructed – Håkon Christie believes that this is a reason why the octagonal church design became popular during the 1700s. Vreim believes that the introduction of log technique after the reformation resulted in a multitude of church designs in Norway.\n\nIn Ukraine, wood church constructions originate from the introduction of Christianity and continued to be widespread, particularly in rural areas, when masonry churches dominated in cities and in Western Europe.\n\nRegional styles \nChurch architecture varies depending on both the sect of the faith, as well as the geographical location and the influences acting upon it. Variances from the typical church architecture as well as unique characteristics can be seen in many areas around the globe.\n\n Armenia \n\n England \nthumb|Westminster Abbey in London\nThe style of churches in England has gone through many changes under the influence of geographical, geological, climatic, religious, social and historical factors. One of the earliest style changes is shown in Westminster Abbey, which was built in a foreign style and was a cause for concern for many as it heralded change. A second example is the current St Paul's Cathedral in London. There are many other notable churches that have each had their own influence on the ever-changing style in England, such as Truro, Westminster Cathedral, Liverpool and Guildford. Between the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, the style of church architecture could be called 'Early English' and 'Decorated'. This time is considered to be when England was in its prime in the category of a church building. It was after the Black Death that the style went through another change, the 'perpendicular style', where ornamentation became more extravagant.\n\nAn architectural element that appeared soon after the Black Death style change and is observed extensively in Medieval English styles is fan vaulting, seen in the Chapel of Henry VII and the King's College Chapel in Cambridge. After this, the prevalent style was Gothic for around 300 years but the style was clearly present for many years before that as well. In these late Gothic times, there was a specific way in which the foundations for the churches were built. First, a stone skeleton would be built, then the spaces between the vertical supports filled with large glass windows, then those windows supported by their own transoms and mullions. On the topic of church windows, the windows are somewhat controversial as some argue that the church should be flooded with light and some argue that they should be dim for an ideal praying environment. Most church plans in England have their roots in one of two styles, Basilican and Celtic and then we see the later emergence of a 'two-cell' plan, consisting of nave and sanctuary.\n\nIn the time before the last war, there was a movement towards a new style of architecture, one that was more functional than embellished. There was an increased use of steel and concrete and a rebellion against the romantic nature of the traditional style. This resulted in a 'battle of the styles' in which one side was leaning towards the modernist, functional way of design, and the other was following traditional Romanesque, Gothic, and Renaissance styles, as reflected in the architecture of all buildings, not just churches.\n\n Wallachia \nthumb|Curtea de Argeș Cathedral\nIn the early Romanian territory of Wallachia, there were three major influences that can be seen. The first are the western influences of Gothic and Romanesque styles, before later falling to the greater influence of the Byzantine styles. The early western influences can be seen in two places, the first is a church in Câmpulung, that showcases distinctly Romanesque styles, and the second are the remnants of a church in Drobeta-Turnu Severin, which has features of the Gothic style. There are not many remaining examples of those two styles, but the Byzantine influence is much more prominent. A few prime examples of the direct Byzantine influence are the St. Nicoara and Domneasca in Curtea de Arges, and church at Nicopolis in Bulgaria. These all show the characteristic features such as sanctuaries, rectangular naves, circular interiors with non-circular exteriors, and small chapels. The Nicopolis church and the Domneasca both have Greek-inspired plans, but the Domneasca is far more developed than the Nicopolis church. Alongside these are also traces of Serbian, Georgian, and Armenian influences that found their way to Wallachia through Serbia.\n\n United States \nthumb|Washington National Cathedral in Northwest, Washington, D.C.\nThe split between Eastern and Western Church Architecture extended its influence into the churches we see in America today as well. America's churches are an amalgamation of the many styles and cultures that collided here, examples being St. Constantine, a Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church in Minneapolis, Polish Cathedral style churches, and Russian Orthodox churches, found all across the country. There are remnants of the Byzantine inspired architecture in many of the churches, such as the large domed ceilings, extensive stonework, and a maximizing of space to be used for religious iconography on walls and such. Churches classified as Ukrainian or Catholic also seem to follow the trend of being overall much more elaborately decorated and accentuated than their Protestant counterparts, in which decoration is simple.\n\nSpecifically in Texas, there are remnants of the Anglo-American colonization that are visible in the architecture itself. Texas in itself was a religious hotbed, and so ecclesiastical architecture developed at a faster pace than in other areas. Looking at the Antebellum period, (1835–1861) Church architecture shows the values and personal beliefs of the architects who created them, while also showcasing Texan cultural history. Both the Catholic and Protestant buildings showed things such as the architectural traditions, economic circumstances, religious ordinances, and aesthetic tastes of those involved. The movement to keep ethnicities segregated during this time was also present in the very foundations of this architecture. Their physical appearances vary wildly from area to area though, as each served its own local purpose, and as mentioned before, due to the multitude of religious groups, each held a different set of beliefs.\n\nSimilarly, many Catholic churches in the southwestern United States – especially in the coastal portions of California – are built with exterior elements in the Mission Revival architecture style, as a tribute to the Spanish missions in California, though often with stained glass windows added and more modern interior elements.\n\n Ethiopia–Eritrea \nthumb|Bete Giyorgis from above, one of the rock-hewn churches of Lalibela, Ethiopia.\n\nAlthough having its roots in the traditions of Eastern Christianity – especially the Syrian church – as well as later being exposed to European influences – the traditional architectural style of Orthodox Tewahedo (Ethiopian Orthodox-Eritrean Orthodox) churches has followed a path all its own. The earliest known churches show the familiar basilican layout. For example, the church of Debre Damo is organized around a nave of four bays separated by re-used monolithic columns; at the western end is a low-roofed narthex, while on the eastern is the maqdas, or Holy of Holies, separated by the only arch in the building.\nthumb|Enda Mariam Cathedral in Asmara, Eritrea. \nThe next period, beginning in the second half of the first millennium AD and lasting into the 16th century, includes both structures built of conventional materials, and those hewn from rock. Although most surviving examples of the first are now found in caves, Thomas Pakenham discovered an example in Wollo, protected inside the circular walls of later construction. An example of these built-up churches would be the church of Yemrehana Krestos, which has many resemblances to the church of Debre Damo both in plan and construction.\n\nThe other style of this period, perhaps the most famous architectural tradition of Ethiopia, are the numerous monolithic churches. This includes houses of worship carved out of the side of mountains, such as Abreha we Atsbeha, which although approximately square the nave and transepts combine to form a cruciform outline – leading experts to categorize Abreha we Atsbeha as an example of cross-in-square churches. Then there are the churches of Lalibela, which were created by excavating into \"a hillside of soft, reddish tuff, variable in hardness and composition\". Some of the churches, such as Biete Amanuel and the cross-shaped Bete Giyorgis, are entirely free-standing with the volcanic tuff removed from all sides, while other churches, such as Biete Gabriel-Rufael and Biete Abba Libanos, are only detached from the living rock on one or two sides. All of the churches are accessed through a labyrinth of tunnels.\n\nThe final period of Ethiopian church architecture, which extends to the present day, is characterized by round churches with conical roofs – quite similar to the ordinary houses the inhabitants of the Ethiopian highlands live in. Despite this resemblance, the interiors are quite different in how their rooms are laid out, based on a three-part division of:\n A maqdas where the tabot is kept, and only priests may enter;\n An inner ambulatory called the qiddist used by communicants at mass; and\n An outer ambulatory, the qene mehlet, used by the dabtaras and accessible to anyone.\n\n East and Southeast Asia \n\nChinese, Vietnamese, Korean, and Japanese architectures have been integrated into church building design. Hundreds of timber-framed churches in Northern Vietnam are constructed with traditional methods, exhibiting great cultural and historical values.Study on Architectural History of Timber-framed Churches in Northern Vietnam. Research project by Tokyo Metropolitan University (2009–2011).\"The Prospects and Possibilities of an Interactive Database for Information Sharing and Rebuilding for a Historical and Cultural Community\".\"A Study on the Timber Framework of Churches in the Northern Vietnam, Bui Chu, Thai Binh, and Phat Diem Dioceses\".\"A Study on Architectural Characteristics of Churches with Vertically-Elongated Timber-Framed Structure in Northern Vietnam\".\"Nhà thờ gỗ không dùng đinh ở Nam Định\".

Dân Trí.\n\nDuring the first decades of the 20th century, a new Sino-Christian church architecture emerged.\n\nSome churches across Southeast Asia have also incorporated traditional architecture, such as the Church of the Sacred Heart, Ganjuran, Java, Indonesia, and the Holy Redeemer Church, Bangkok, Thailand.\n\nTaiwan\n\nIn East Asia, Taiwan is one of several countries famous for its church architecture. The Spanish Fort Santo Domingo in the 17th century had an adjacent church. The Dutch Fort Zeelandia in Tainan also included a chapel. In modern architecture several churches have been inspired to use traditional designs. These include the Church of the Good Shepherd in Shihlin (Taipei), which was designed by Su Hsi Tsung and built in the traditional siheyuan style. The chapel of Taiwan Theological College and Seminary includes a pagoda shape and traditional tile-style roof. Zhongshan and Jinan Presbyterian churches were built during the Japanese era (1895–1945) and reflect a Japanese aesthetic.Taipei City Government, \"Religious Centers: A Grand Tour of Beloved and Blessed Local Church Architecture\", accessed 2/10/2020. Tunghai University's Luce Memorial Chapel, designed by IM Pei's firm, is often held up as an example of a modern, contextualized style.\n\n The Philippines \n\nSpanish, Austronesian, and Chinese construction ideas merged during the Spanish era of the Philippines (late 15th to late 19th century), which is the only Christian-majority nation in the Far East together with the small island nation of East Timor. These traditions had to adapt to the tropical climate and earthquake-prone environment, which resulted in a new types of arquitectura mestiza unique to the archipelago developed over three centuries.\n\nConvents and monasteries were primarily built in the bahay na bato tradition, which had the architectural principle of native Austronesian framework which was improvised with Chinese elements. Stone masonry introduced by Spaniards, and ornaments mostly Classical tradition.\"The City of God: Churches, Convents and Monasteries\". Discovering Philippines. Retrieved on 2011-07-06. Most early churches, though illiterate, with limited knowledge from the cooperation between Spanish friars and Chinese architects with native manpower, drew from Renaissance, Baroque and Mudéjar traditions while complying with the tropical climate and earthquake-prone environment of the islands, resulting in an architectural style known as Filipino Baroque or Earthquake Baroque, characterized by fortress-like thick walls and  (buttresses); squat cylindrical, rectangular or octagonal belfries also serving as watch towers; local motifs; and in some extent, Asian guardian lions as grotesques. Though still retaining its unique local characteristics, the styles became more literate as more architects arrived from the other parts of the Spanish Empire, and even started incorporating newer styles such as Neoclassical, Neo-Gothic and Neo-Romanesque.\n\nGothic era church architecture \nGothic-era architecture, originating in 12th-century France, is a style where curves, arches, and complex geometry are highly emphasized. These intricate structures, often of immense size, required great amounts of planning, effort and resources; involved large numbers of engineers and laborers; and often took hundreds of years to complete—all of which was considered a tribute to God.\n\n Characteristics \nThe characteristics of a Gothic-style church are largely in congruence with the ideology that the more breathtaking a church is, the better it reflects the majesty of God. This was accomplished through clever math and engineering in a time period where complex shapes, especially in huge cathedrals, were not typically found in structures. Through this newly implemented skill of being able to design complex shapes churches consisted of namely pointed arches, curved lights and windows, and rib vaults. Since these newly popular designs were implemented with respect to the width of the church rather than height, width was much more desired rather than height.\n\n Art \nGothic architecture in churches had a heavy emphasis on art. Just like the structure of the building, there was an emphasis on complex geometric shapes. An example of this is stained glass windows, which can still be found in modern churches. Stained glass windows were both artistic and functional in the way that they allowed colored light to enter the church and create a heavenly atmosphere. Other popular art styles in the Gothic era were sculptures. Creating lifelike depictions of figures, again with the use of complex curves and shapes. Artists would include a high level of detail to best preserve and represent their subject.\n\n Time periods and styles \nThe Gothic era, first referred to by historiographer Giorgio Vasari, began in northeastern France and slowly spread throughout Europe. It was perhaps most characteristically expressed in the Rayonnant style, originating in the 13th century, known for its exaggerated geometrical features that made everything as astounding and eye-catching as possible. Gothic churches were often highly decorated, with geometrical features applied to already complex structural forms. By the time the Gothic period neared its close, its influence had spread to residences, guild halls, and public and government buildings.\n\n Notable examples \n Chartres Cathedral\n Santa Maria del Fiore\n Cologne Cathedral\n Notre Dame de Paris\n Monastery of Batalha\n Metz Cathedral\n Canterbury Cathedral\n Salisbury Cathedral\n Westminster Abbey \n Wells Cathedral\n Gloucester Cathedral\n St Giles Cathedral\n Glasgow Cathedral\n\nThe Reformation and its influence on church architecture\n\nthumb|Court chapel at Wilhelmsburg Castle, Germany, built in 1590, with the altar with baptismal font, pulpit and organ connected in a vertical axis\n\nIn the early 16th century, the Reformation brought a period of radical change to church design. On Christmas Day 1521, Andreas Karlstadt performed the first reformed communion service. In early January 1522, the Wittenberg city council authorized the removal of imagery from churches and affirmed the changes introduced by Karlstadt on Christmas. According to the ideals of the Protestant Reformation, the spoken word, the sermon, should be central act in the church service. This implied that the pulpit became the focal point of the church interior and that churches should be designed to allow all to hear and see the minister. Pulpits had always been a feature of Western churches. The birth of Protestantism led to extensive changes in the way that Christianity was practiced (and hence the design of churches).\n\nDuring the Reformation period, there was an emphasis on \"full and active participation\". The focus of Protestant churches was on the preaching of the Word, rather than a sacerdotal emphasis. Holy Communion tables became wood to emphasise that Christ's sacrifice was made once for all and were made more immediate to the congregation to emphasise man's direct access to God through Christ. Therefore, Catholic churches were redecorated when they became reformed: Paintings and statues of saints were removed and sometimes the altar table was placed in front of the pulpit, as in Strasbourg Cathedral in 1524. The pews were turned towards the pulpit. Wooden galleries were built to allow more worshippers to follow the sermon.\n\nThe first newly built Protestant church was the court chapel of Neuburg Castle in 1543, followed by the court chapel of Hartenfels Castle in Torgau, consecrated by Martin Luther on 5 October 1544.\n\nImages and statues were sometimes removed in disorderly attacks and unofficial mob actions (in the Netherlands called the Beeldenstorm). Medieval churches were stripped of their decorations, such as the Grossmünster in Zürich in 1524, a stance enhanced by the Calvinist reformation, beginning with its main church, St. Pierre Cathedral in Geneva, in 1535. At the Peace of Augsburg of 1555, which ended a period of armed conflict between Roman Catholic and Protestant forces within the Holy Roman Empire, the rulers of the German-speaking states and Charles V, the Habsburg Emperor, agreed to accept the principle Cuius regio, eius religio, meaning that the religion of the ruler was to dictate the religion of those ruled.\n\nIn the Netherlands the Reformed church in Willemstad, North Brabant was built in 1607 as the first Protestant church building in the Netherlands, a domed church with an octagonal shape, according to Calvinism's focus on the sermon. The Westerkerk of Amsterdam was built between 1620 and 1631 in Renaissance style and remains the largest church in the Netherlands that was built for Protestants.\n\nthumbnail|The Protestant wooden church in Hronsek (Slovakia) was built in 1726.\nBy the beginning of the 17th century, in spite of the cuius regio principle, the majority of the peoples in the Habsburg monarchy had become Protestant, sparking the Counter-Reformation by the Habsburg emperors which resulted in the Thirty Years' War in 1618. In the Peace of Westphalia treaties of 1648 which ended the war, the Habsburgs were obliged to tolerate three Protestant churches in their province of Silesia, where the counter-reformation had not been completely successful, as in Austria, Bohemia and Hungary, and about half of the population still remained Protestant. However, the government ordered these three churches to be located outside the towns, not to be recognisable as churches, they had to be wooden structures, to look like barns or residential houses, and they were not allowed to have towers or bells. The construction had to be accomplished within a year. Accordingly, the Protestants built their three Churches of Peace, huge enough to give space for more than 5,000 people each. Two of them are still existing and have been declared UNESCO World Heritage Sites. When Protestant troops under Swedish leadership again threatened to invade the Habsburg territories during the Great Northern War, the Habsburgs were forced to allow more Protestant churches within their empire with the Treaty of Altranstädt (1707), however limiting these with similar requirements, the so-called Gnadenkirchen (Churches of Grace). They were mostly smaller wooden structures like the one in Hronsek (Slovakia) of 1726.\n\nIn Britain during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, it became usual for Anglican churches to display the Royal Arms inside, either as a painting or as a relief, to symbolise the monarch's role as head of the church.\n\nDuring the 17th and 18th centuries, Protestant churches were built in the Baroque style that originated in Italy, however consciously more simply decorated. Some could still become fairly grand, for instance, the Katarina Church, Stockholm, St. Michael's Church, Hamburg or the Dresden Frauenkirche, built between 1726 and 1743 as a sign of the will of the citizen to remain Protestant after their ruler had converted to Catholicism.\n\nthumb|Interior of Ludwigskirche in Saarbrücken (1762)\nSome churches were built with a new and genuinely Protestant alignment: the transept became the main church while the nave was omitted, for instance at the Ludwigskirche in Saarbrücken of 1762; this building scheme was also quite popular in Switzerland, with the largest being the churches of Wädenswil (1767) and Horgen (1782). A new Protestant interior design scheme was established in many German Lutheran churches during the 18th century, following the example of the court chapel of Wilhelmsburg Castle of 1590: The connection of altar with baptismal font, pulpit and organ in a vertical axis. The central painting above the altar was replaced with the pulpit. \n\nNeo-Lutheranism in the early 19th century criticized this scheme as being too profane. The German Evangelical Church Conference, therefore, recommended the Gothic language of forms for church building in 1861. Gothic Revival architecture began its triumphal march. With regard to Protestant churches, it was not only an expression of historism, but also of a new theological programme which put the Lord's supper above the sermon again. The Berlin Cathedral is a triumphal Lutheran cathedral built in 1893 by Emperor Wilhelm II in high Neo-Renaissance style.\n\nthumb|Ringkirche in Wiesbaden (1892–94)\nAround 1880, two decades after the Neo-Gothic recommendation, liberal Lutherans and Calvinists expressed their wish for a new genuinely Protestant church architecture, conceived on the basis of liturgical requirements. The spaces for altar and worshippers should no longer be separated from each other. Accordingly, churches should not only give space for service, but also for social activities of the parish. Churches were to be seen as meeting houses for the celebrating faithful. The Ringkirche in Wiesbaden was the first church realised according to this ideology in 1892–94, albeit still in neo-Gothic form. The unity of the parish was expressed by an architecture that united the pulpit and the altar in its circle, following early Calvinist tradition. In modern architecture, especially from the 1950s and 1960s until today, many churches were built according to these specifications. These protestant ideas have also had an impact on modern Catholic church architecture: When St. Hedwig's Cathedral in Berlin was rebuilt after the Second World War, a similar arrangement was chosen, which was also retained in the most recent redesign of its interior. Many new Catholic churches now also follow this program.\n\nModernism\n\nThe idea that worship was a corporate activity and that the congregation should be in no way excluded from sight or participation derives from the Liturgical Movement. Simple one-room plans are almost of the essence of modernity in architecture. In France and Germany between the first and second World Wars, some of the major developments took place. The Église Notre-Dame du Raincy near Paris by Auguste Perret is cited as the starting point of process, not only for its plan but also for the materials used, reinforced concrete. \n\nUnder Romano Guardini's leadership, the chapel at Rothenfels Castle became the heart of the liturgical movement, which anticipated key ideas of the Second Vatican Council. Inspired by the Dessau Bauhaus and his studying under the master builder Hans Poelzig in Berlin, the architect Rudolf Schwartz designed the interiors as well as many of the furnishings of the castle chapel. Schwarz became hugely influential on later church building, not only in Europe but also in the United States of America. Schloss Rothenfels was a large rectangular space, with solid white walls, deep windows and a stone pavement. It had no decoration. The only furniture consisted of a hundred little black cuboid moveable stools. For worship, an altar was set up and the faithful surrounded it on three sides.\n\nCorpus Christi in Aachen was Schwartz's first parish church and adheres to the same principles, very much reminiscent of the Bauhaus movement of art. Externally it is a plan cube; the interior has white walls and colourless windows, a langbau i.e. a narrow rectangle at the end of which is the altar. It was to be, said Schwartz not 'christocentric' but 'theocentric'. In front of the altar were simple benches. Behind the altar was a great white void of a back wall, signifying the region of the invisible Father. The influence of this simplicity spread to Switzerland with such architects as Fritz Metzger and Dominikus Böhm.\n\nthumb|Model of Notre Dame du Haut by Le Corbusier (1954)\nthumb|Notre Dame du Haut: The open altar facing east and an outer pulpit\nAfter the Second World War, Metzger continued to develop his ideas, notably with the church of St. Franziskus at Riehen near Basel, Switzerland (1950). Another notable building is the chapel Notre Dame du Haut at Ronchamp by Le Corbusier (1954) with an open altar facing east and an outer pulpit. Similar principles of simplicity and continuity of style throughout can be found in the United States, in particular at the Roman Catholic Abbey church of St. Procopius, in Lisle, near Chicago (1971).\n\nA theological principle which resulted in change was the decree Sacrosanctum Concilium of the Second Vatican Council issued in December 1963. This encouraged 'active participation' (in Latin: participatio actuosa) by the faithful in the celebration of the liturgy by the people and required that new churches should be built with this in mind (para 124) Subsequently, rubrics and instructions encouraged the use of a freestanding altar allowing the priest to face the people. The effect of these changes can be seen in such churches as the Roman Catholic Metropolitan Cathedrals of Liverpool and the Brasília, both circular buildings with a free-standing altar.\n\nDifferent principles and practical pressures produced other changes. Parish churches were inevitably built more modestly. Often shortage of finances, as well as a 'market place' theology suggested the building of multi-purpose churches, in which secular and sacred events might take place in the same space at different times. Again, the emphasis on the unity of the liturgical action, was countered by a return to the idea of movement. Three spaces, one for the baptism, one for the liturgy of the word and one for the celebration of the Eucharist with a congregation standing around an altar, were promoted by Richard Giles in England and the United States. The congregation were to process from one place to another. Such arrangements were less appropriate for large congregations than for small; for the former, proscenium arch arrangements with huge amphitheatres such as at Willow Creek Community Church in Chicago in the United States (which resembles an office building from the outside) have been one answer.\n\nExamples of Brutalist architecture are: The Sanctuary in Velbert, Germany, the Markus Church, Stockholm, Sweden, the Catholic church St Gallus, Lichtensteig, Switzerland (which resembles a tenement from the outside).\n\nPostmodernism\nAs with other Postmodern movements, the Postmodern movement in architecture formed in reaction to the ideals of modernism as a response to the perceived blandness, hostility, and utopianism of the Modern movement. While rare in designs of church architecture, there are nonetheless some notable for recover and renew historical styles and \"cultural memory\" of Christian architecture. Notable practitioners include Dr. Steven Schloeder, Duncan Stroik, and Thomas Gordon Smith.\n\nThe functional and formalized shapes and spaces of the modernist movement are replaced by unapologetically diverse aesthetics: styles collide, form is adopted for its own sake, and new ways of viewing familiar styles and space abound. Perhaps most obviously, architects rediscovered the expressive and symbolic value of architectural elements and forms that had evolved through centuries of building—often maintaining meaning in literature, poetry and art—but which had been abandoned by the modern movement. Church buildings in Nigeria evolved from its foreign monument look of old to the contemporary design which makes it look like a factory.",

Formerly thought to have been a Roman road, modern archaeologists think that it was built either in the 1st century AD by the Brigantian tribes as a defence against the Roman invasion of Britain, or after the 5th century to defend the kingdom of Elmet from the Angles.\n\nThe southernmost end of the dyke is thought to have been close to Lady's Bridge at the River Don in Sheffield, but today it only becomes visible close to the Iron Age fort at Wincobank. The dyke continues in a north-easterly direction following the Don Valley to Kimberworth in Rotherham where it splits into two branches that continue roughly parallel to each other in a sweep starting to the north-east and turning east. The southern branch passes through Greasbrough, intersecting the River Don just south of Swinton at Kilnhurst. The northern branch passes close to another Iron Age fort at Scholes Coppice and runs to the north of Swinton, meeting the River Don at Mexborough.\n\nPart of the western end of the ridge was used in the Middle Ages to demarcate the boundary of Ecclesfield and Sheffield.  This western part parallels the Don, and a report of 1891 in the Sheffield Independent stated that it had formerly run as far west as Bridgehouses.  Part of the northern branch formed the boundary between Wath-on-Dearne on the one side and Rawmarsh and Swinton on the other.David Hey, Medieval South Yorkshire",

    "clean_text": "Frederic Henry Gravely (7 December 1885 – 1965) was an eminent British arachnologist, entomologist, botanist, zoologist and student of archaeology, who conducted pioneering research and wrote extensively on various subjects during his tenure at the Indian Museum, Calcutta, and the Government Museum, Madras.\n\nEarly life\nthumb|left|F.H. Gravely in 1921 (seated on chair, left most)\nGravely was born in 1885 in Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, England to Arthur Frederic Gravely and Margaret Hutchinson, the eldest of four children. The family were Quakers and although the father was a businessman, he was interested in natural history. His mother came from a farming family which also produced Sir Jonathan Hutchinson. At the age of nine he moved to a boarding school in Sheffield. He then studied at Ackworth and Bootham (both Quaker schools) before moving to Manchester University to study zoology.Aiyappan, A. (1951) Madras Government Museum Centenary Souvenir (1851-1951). pp. 39-50.\n\nIndian Museum, Calcutta\nGravely graduated in 1906 and became a demonstrator at Manchester in 1907. He was elected to membership of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society on 15 October 1907https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/Memoirs_and_proceedings_of_the_Manchester_Literary_%26_Philosophical_Society_%28IA_memoirsproceedin55manc%29.pdf\np xlix and gave his address as Natural History Dept., Indian Museum, Calcutta. He worked on collections made in the \"Discovery\" Antarctic Expedition along with S.J. Hickson and worked on Polychaete Larvae. In 1909 he was appointed Assistant Superintendent of the Indian Museum Calcutta. In 1914, still at Calcutta, he received his D.Sc. for the work on the Oriental Passalidae. He unified the monographs of early observers with the notes of Arrow and Zang to bring to the oriental passalids (1914), and the family itself in general (1918), the classification that is in vogue today with minor alterations.\n\nGovernment Museum, Madras\nDr. Gravely became the Superintendent of the Government Museum of Madras in 1920. Over the next two decades, he undertook the investigation of the littoral fauna of Krusadai Island, Gulf of Mannar, revived the Bulletin of the museum, and embarked on the scientific preservation, study and interpretation of the museum's collections. His work on Arachnida and Mollusca significantly enhanced the collections of the museum in the two zoological groups. He was also responsible for enlarging the reserve collection, particularly of Invertebrates.\n\nDr. Gravely contributed to the overall development of the museum as well. He, along with the Curator Dr. C. Sivaramamurti, ensured in 1938 that the antiquities and industrial art collected by the museum was organized effectively, into a collection that exists even today. The most important of Dr. Gravely's many contributions to the subject was the monograph he collaborated on with T. N. Ramachandran (Curator of Archaeology 1925–1935) on the scientific basis for identifying the period of metal images. Dr. Gravely also donated a variety of sculptures, carvings and bronzes to other institutions, including the Prince of Wales Museum, the Lucknow Museum and Dr. Ananda Coomaraswami's Museum in Boston. Dr. Gravely, and P V Mayuranathan considerably enhanced the Herbarium and the botanical collections of the museum.\n\nDr. Gravely pioneered the preservation of bronzes collected by the museum. He initiated the electrolytic restoration process which has helped preserve not only bronze objects, but also ethnological, pre-historic and numismatic collections. He also built a separate Chemical Conservation Laboratory, the only one of its kind at the time, in 1937.\n\nOther contributions\nHe was one of the Foundation Fellows of the National Institute of Sciences of India, now the apex scientific body in the country, Indian National Science Academy. He also served as the Secretary to the Asiatic Society in the period 1915–18.\nHis insect and spider collection is in the Indian Museum, Calcutta. It notably contain insects, Arachnida and Myriapoda from limestone caves in Burma (1911), and oriental Passalidae.\n\nPersonal life\nIn 1925 he married Laura Balling and they had a daughter Ann Margaret (born 1928) and a son John Frederic (born 1931). He supported the Toc H of which the first Indian branch was set up in the \"Museum House\".",

    "title": "Eiji Tsuburaya",
    "clean_text": "was a Japanese special effects director, filmmaker, and cinematographer. A co-creator of the Godzilla and Ultraman franchises, he is considered one of the most important and influential figures in the history of cinema. Tsuburaya is known as the  having pioneered Japan's special effects industry and introduced several technological developments in film productions. In a career spanning five decades, Tsuburaya worked on approximately 250 films—including globally renowned features directed by Ishirō Honda, Hiroshi Inagaki, and Akira Kurosawa—and earned six Japan Technical Awards.\n\nFollowing a brief stint as an inventor, Tsuburaya was employed by Japanese cinema pioneer Yoshirō Edamasa in 1919 and began his career working as an assistant cinematographer on Edamasa's A Tune of Pity. Thereafter, he worked as an assistant cinematographer on several films, including Teinosuke Kinugasa's A Page of Madness (1926). At the age of thirty-two, Tsuburaya watched King Kong, which greatly influenced him to work in special effects. Tsuburaya completed the first iron shooting crane in October 1934, and an adaptation of the crane is still in use across the globe today. After filming his directorial debut on the cruiser Asama in the Pacific Ocean, he worked on Princess Kaguya (1935), one of Japan's first major films to incorporate special effects. His first majorly successful film in effects, The Daughter of the Samurai (1937), remarkably featured the first full-scale rear projection.\n\nIn 1937, Tsuburaya was employed by Toho and established the company's effects department. Tsuburaya directed the effects for The War at Sea from Hawaii to Malaya in 1942, which became the highest-grossing Japanese film in history upon its release. His elaborate effects were believed to be behind the film's major success, and he won an award for his work from the Japan Motion Picture Cinematographers Association. In 1948, however, Tsuburaya was purged from Toho by the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers because of his involvement in propaganda films during World War II. Thus, he founded Tsuburaya Special Technology Laboratory with his eldest son Hajime and worked without credit at major Japanese studios outside Toho, creating effects for films such as Daiei's The Invisible Man Appears (1949), widely regarded as the first Japanese science fiction film.\n\nIn 1950, Tsuburaya returned to Toho alongside his effects crew from Tsuburaya Special Technology Laboratory. At age fifty-three, he gained international recognition and won his first Japan Technical Award for Special Skill for directing the effects in Ishirō Honda's kaiju film Godzilla (1954). He served as the effects director for Toho's string of financially successful tokusatsu films that followed, including, Rodan (1956), The Mysterians (1957), The Three Treasures (1959), Mothra, The Last War (both 1961), and King Kong vs. Godzilla (1962). In April 1963, Tsuburaya founded Tsuburaya Special Effects Productions; his company would go onto produce the television shows Ultra Q, Ultraman (both 1966), Ultraseven (1967–1968), and Mighty Jack (1968). Ultra Q and Ultraman were extremely successful upon their 1966 broadcast, with Ultra Q making him a household name in Japan and gaining him more attention from the media who dubbed him the \"God of Tokusatsu\". While he spent his late years working on several Toho films and operating his company, Tsuburaya's health began to decline, and he died in 1970.\n\nBiography\nChildhood to war years: 1901–1945\nChildhood and youth (1901–1919)\nleft|thumb|upright|Tsuburaya with his mother Sei, . Sei died of illness shortly after giving birth to her second son.|alt=A mother in a kimono holds her newborn child.\nEiji Tsuburaya was born  on July 7, 1901, at a merchant house called Ōtsukaya in Sukagawa, Iwase, Fukushima Prefecture, where his family ran a malted rice business. He was the first son of Isamu Shiraishi and Sei Tsumuraya, with a large extended family. When Tsuburaya was three years old, his mother Sei died of illness at the age of nineteen, shortly after giving birth to her second son. Bereaved by Sei's death, Shiraishi divorced her posthumously and left the family, leaving Tsuburaya in the care of his grandmother Natsu. Through Natsu, Tsuburaya was related to the Edo period painter Aōdō Denzen, who brought copper printing and Western painting to Japan, from whom Tsuburaya considered to have inherited his manual dexterity. His uncle Ichirō, who was Sei's younger brother, was five years older than him and acted like an elder brother to him. Thus, Tsuburaya began to use the nickname Eiji (\"ji\" indicating second-born) instead of Eiichi (\"ichi\" indicating first-born).\n\nIn 1908, he started attending the Dai'ichi Jinjo Koto Elementary School in Sukagawa, and it was soon realized that he had a talent for drawing. During his boyhood, Tsuburaya became interested in flying because of the recent success of Japanese aviators; he soon started building model airplanes as a hobby, an interest he would pursue throughout his entire life.\n\nIn 1913, Tsuburaya saw his first film, which featured footage of a volcanic eruption on Sakurajima; in the process, he was more fascinated by the projector than the movie itself. In 1958, Tsuburaya told Kinema Junpo that because he was extremely fascinated by the projector, he purchased a \"toy movie viewer\" and created his own film strips by \"carefully cutting rolled paper, then making sprocket holes, and drawing stick figures [on the paper], frame by frame.\" Because of his craftwork at a young age, he became a provincial celebrity and was interviewed by the .\n\nIn 1915, at the age of 14, he graduated from junior high school, and begged his family to let him enroll in the Nippon Flying School at Haneda. After the school was closed on account of the accidental death of its founder, Seitaro Tamai, in 1917, Tsuburaya switched to the Tokyo Kanda Electrical Engineering School (now Tokyo Denki University). While at the school, he started working as an inventor at the toy company Utsumi, and devised inventions including the first battery-powered phone capable of making calls, an automatic speed photo box, an \"automatic skate\" and the toy phone. The latter two earned him a patent fee of .\n\nEarly career and marriage (1919–1934)\n\nDuring a hanami party held at a tea house in the spring of 1919, Tsuburaya met Yoshirō Edamasa, a pioneer of Japanese cinema. Edamasa asked Tsuburaya if he was interested in movies or photography; after he explained to Edamasa that he was interested in motion pictures, Tsuburaya accepted the director's offer to become an employee at his company, the Natural Color Motion Pictures Company (dubbed \"Tenkatsu\"). Therefore, Tsuburaya began working in the film industry at the age of eighteen, as Edamasa's camera assistant, contributing to films such as A Tune of Pity (1919) and Tombs of the Island (1920); reportedly, he also served as a screenwriter during this period. Despite Tenkatsu becoming part of the Kokatsu Company and Edamasa leaving his job in March 1920, Tsuburaya kept working at the studio until he was ordered to serve the Imperial Japanese Army between 1921 and December 1922.\n\nAfter leaving the army in 1923, Tsuburaya moved back to his family's house in Sukagawa. However, he suddenly departed just a few months later, in order to pursue a more established career within the filmmaking industry. In the morning of his departure from home, he left a note: \"I won't return home until I succeed in the motion picture business, even if I die trying.\" The next year, he worked as the cinematographer on the film The Hunchback of Enmei'in Temple. Tsuburaya joined Shochiku in 1925 and would have his breakthrough as the cameraman and assistant director on Teinosuke Kinugasa's A Page of Madness (released the following year). In 1927, he shot Minoru Inuzuka's jidaigeki films Children's Swordplay and Melee, both starring Kazuo Hasegawa and Tsuyako Okajima, as well as Toko Yamazaki's The Bat Copybook, Mad Blade Under the Moon, and Record of the Tragic Swords of the Tenpo Era. Because of the financial success of these films, Tsuburaya started being regarded as one of Kyoto's leading cinematographers.\n\nIn 1928, while working on eleven films at Shochiku, Tsuburaya began creating and utilizing new camera operating techniques, including double-exposure and slow-motion camerawork. The next year, Tsuburaya constructed his own smaller version of D. W. Griffith's 140-foot tall shooting crane: having invented it without the benefit of using blueprints or manuals, the wooden crane allowed Tsuburaya to improve camera movement and was able to be used in and outside the studio. The creation proved to be a success, although it did not guarantee total safety: one day, while Tsuburaya and an assistant were preparing the crane in order to film a scene, the structure collapsed, sending him plummeting to the ground of the studio. A witness of the incident, named Masano Araki, was one of the first people to run to his aid: she visited Tsuburaya daily while he was hospitalized, and the pair formed a relationship shortly thereafter. On February 27, 1930, Tsuburaya married the decade-younger Araki. Their first child, Hajime, was born on April 23, 1931.\n\nIn May 1932, Tsuburaya, Akira Mimura, Hiroshi Sakai, Kohei Sugiyama, Masao Tamai, and Tadayuki Yokota established the Japan Cameraman Association, which later coalesced with other companies to become the Nippon Cinematographers Club (now known as the ). Shortly after that, the association would start to hold award ceremonies. In November of that same year, Tsuburaya quit Shochiku and joined Nikkatsu Futosou Studios. Around the same time, he began using the professional name \"Eiji Tsuburaya\".\n\nIn 1933, Tsuburaya saw the American film King Kong, which inspired him to work on movies featuring special effects. In 1962, Tsuburaya told the Mainichi Shimbun that he attempted to convince Nikkatsu to \"import this technical know-how, but they had little interest in it because, at the time, I was seen as merely a cameraman who worked on Kazuo Hasegawa's historical dramas\". He managed to acquire a 35mm print of King Kong and started to study the film's special effects frame-by-frame, without the advantage of documents explaining how they were produced: he would later write an analysis of the film's effects for the magazine Photo Times in October 1933. In the same year, Masano gave birth to a second child, a daughter named Miyako. However, the child would die of unknown causes in 1935.\n\nIn December 1933, Nikkatsu granted Tsuburaya permission to use and study new screen projection technology for the company's jidaigeki films. However, while the studio agreed with his decision to project these films cast into a location use using location plates, not all of his technological developments were met with approval. While he was filming the final scenes for Asataro Descends Mt. Akagi in February 1934, Tsuburaya fell out with Nikkatsu's CEO, who had no acquaintance with what Tsuburaya was creating and assumed that he was wasting the company's money. After the argument, Tsuburaya resigned from his job at Nikkatsu.\n\nJ.O. Studios, directorial works, and Toho (1934–1940)\nright|thumb|upright|Tsuburaya riding his iron shooting crane in 1934. An adaptation of this crane is still used worldwide today.\n\nShortly after leaving Nikkatsu, he accepted an offer from Kyoto entrepreneur Yoshio Osawa to work at his company, J.O. Talkies, and research optical printing and screen projection. In October 1934, Tsuburaya and his colleagues completed the first iron shooting crane model and used it to shoot Atsuo Tomioka's The Chorus of a Million. In contrast to his previous prototype, the crane was installed on a truck that operated on tracks, which made it able to change the camera's position in a matter of seconds. In December of that year, Osawa renamed the studio J.O. Studios and designated Tsuburaya as its chief cinematographer.\n\nFrom February to August 1935, he traveled to Hawaii, the Philippines, Australia, and New Zealand on the cruiser Asama in order to shoot his directorial debut, Three Thousand Miles Across the Equator, a feature-length propaganda documentary film. During the expedition, his second son, Noboru, was born on May 10, 1935.\n\nUpon returning from the voyage, Tsuburaya began work on Princess Kaguya, an adaptation of the 10th-century Japanese literary tale The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter. He did not only serve as the film's cinematographer, but was also in charge of special effects for the first time. For the film, he worked with animator Kenzō Masaoka to create miniatures, puppets, a composite of Kaguya emerging from a cut bamboo plant, and a sequence in which a ship encounters a storm. While the original print of the film is considered to be lost, a shortened version, screened in England in 1936, was discovered by a researcher at the British Film Institute in May 2015: this version was released in Japan on September 4 and 5, 2021, as part of an event celebrating Tsuburaya's 120th birthday.\n\nthumb|left|upright|Publicity still of geisha singer Ichimaru playing the female lead in Tsuburaya's first histrionic film, Folk Song Collection: Oichi of Torioi Village.\nIn March of the next year, Tsuburaya's directorial debut, the theatrical play Folk Song Collection: Oichi of Torioi Village, was released: it was an adventure film concerning a condemned romance and featuring political tones. Folk Song Collection: Oichi of Torioi Village was the second film to ever star popular geisha singer Ichimaru, while also featuring actor Kenji Susukida. Soon after its completion, Tsuburaya began working on Arnold Fanck's The Daughter of the Samurai (released in 1937). The Daughter of the Samurai was the first German-Japanese co-production, and is considered to be Tsuburaya's first major success as a special effects director, since it featured the first full-scale rear projection. The German staff were allegedly impressed by his elaborate miniature work on the project.\n\nIn September 1936, Ichizō Kobayashi merged the film studios P.C.L. Studios and P.C.L. Film Company with J.O. Studios to create the film and theatre production company Toho. Film producer  was appointed as production manager at Toho: having become aware of the importance of special effects during a tour in Hollywood, in 1937 Mori hired Tsuburaya at the company's studio in Tokyo, establishing the special effects department on November 27, 1937, and treating him as the section's manager. Shortly after, Tsuburaya received a research budget and began studying optical printers to create Japan's first version of the device, which he designed. Among Tsuburaya's first film assignments at Toho were The Abe Clan, a jidaigeki film directed by Hisatora Kumagai, and the unreleased propaganda musical The Song of Major Nango (both 1938). The latter film was directed and shot by Tsuburaya, and he completed it on September 6 of that year.\n\nIn 1939, he was ordered to join the Kumagaya Aviation Academy of the Imperial Army Corps, where he was entrusted to shoot flight-training films. After impressing his superiors with his aerial photography, Tsuburaya was given more assignments and a master's certificate during his almost three years at the academy. In November 1939, while Tsuburaya was still at the flight school and undertaking assignments at Toho, he was appointed head of Toho's Special Arts Department. A month after that, he was commissioned to shoot a science film for Toho's then-recently assembled educational section. Under governance demands, Toho was mandated to maintain the creation of propaganda films. Accordingly, in May 1940, Tsuburaya began directing the documentary The Imperial Way of Japan for Toho Education Films' branch, the Toho National Policy Film Association. He was given his first ever credits for special effects for his work on Sotoji Kimura's Navy Bomber Squadron, which featured a bombing scene with a miniature airplane. Navy Bomber Squadron was believed to be lost for over sixty years, until an unfinished copy of the film was discovered and screened in 2006.\n\nIn September 1940, Yutaka Abe's The Burning Sky, was released to Japanese cinemas. Tsuburaya was in charge of effects for the film and received his first accolade from the Japan Motion Picture Cinematographers Association. His next undertaking, Son Gokū, was released on November 6, 1940. During an interview for the August 1960 issue of American Cinematographer, he broke down the creative process behind Son Gokū, saying: \"I was called upon to create and photograph a monkey-like monster which was supposed to fly through the air\", adding: \"I managed the job with some success and this assignment set the pattern for my future work.\"\n\nWar years (1941–1945)\nthumb|right|thumbtime=5500|English subtitled print of The War at Sea from Hawaii to Malaya (1942), which featured an acclaimed depiction of the Pearl Harbor attack created by Tsuburaya\nOn December 7, 1941, the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service suddenly attacked the U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor: consequently, the Imperial Japanese Government tasked Toho to produce a propaganda film that would influence the nation to believe they would win the Pacific War. The resulting film, Kajirō Yamamoto's war epic The War at Sea from Hawaii to Malaya (1942), became the highest-grossing Japanese film in history upon its release in December 1942 and won Kinema Junpos Best Film Award. Tsuburaya directed its effects, which he created with the assistance of navy-provided photographs of the Pearl Harbor attack: in the process, he also worked with future Godzilla collaborates Akira Watanabe and Teizō Toshimitsu for the first time in his career. His work on the film was supposedly one of the main reasons behind its major success and gained him the Technical Research Award from the Japan Motion Picture Cinematographers Association. The film depicted the attack so realistically that footage from it was later featured in documentaries on the Pearl Harbor attack.\n\nAround the same time as The War at Sea from Hawaii to Malaya was in production, Toho's effects department was filming Japan's first puppet film, Ramayana. The film's screenplay—based on the Sanskrit epic of the same name—had been written by future Moonlight Mask creator Kōhan Kawauchi in 1941, under Tsuburaya's supervision.\n\nTsuburaya's next four major productions were all war films: Masahiro Makino's The Opium War, Tadashi Imai's Watchtower Suicide Squad, Kunio Watanabe's Decisive Battle in the Skies and Kajirō Yamamoto's follow-up to The War at Sea from Hawaii to Malaya, General Kato's Falcon Fighters (all produced in 1943). For The Opium War, Tsuburaya and his team created miniature navy battle sequences and animation synthesis in urban landscapes. During the production of General Kato's Falcon Fighters (released in 1944), Tsuburaya had his first meeting with future collaborator and filmmaker Ishirō Honda. After watching The War at Sea from Hawaii to Malaya, Honda became interested in special effects and believed Tsuburaya's work in General Kato's Falcon Fighters was inferior in scope, but the art and gunpowder technology had enhanced. Additionally, Tsuburaya expressed dissatisfaction with the size of the shooting stage, the art materials, the method of performance, etc.\n\nShortly before Toho distributed General Kato's Falcon Fighters in cinemas, Masano and Tsuburaya's third son and last child, Akira, was born on February 12, 1944. Akira was the first of the couple's sons to be baptized, since Masano had been converted to Catholicism by her younger sister. Masano persisted in introducing her children to the Catholic faith and ultimately converted her husband.\n\nIn 1944, Tsuburaya met future Godzilla producer Tomoyuki Tanaka during the production of the Mikio Naruse-directed war film , which was Tanaka's debut as a film producer. Tanaka stated that he did not develop a serious connection with Tsuburaya during the film's production. The following year, the special effects director collaborated with Tanaka for the second time on Kiyoshi Saeki's .\n\nOn March 10, 1945, Tsuburaya and his family sought refuge for two hours in their residence's bomb shelter during the Tokyo air raids. During the two-hour-long attacks, he told his children fairy tales to keep them quiet. Later that year, Tsuburaya made the effects in Torajirō Saitō's Five Men from Tokyo, for which he was credited as \"Eiichi Tsuburaya\". Five Men from Tokyo is a comedy film concerning five men who struggle to make a living after returning to Tokyo and remaining unemployed due to the Tokyo air raids on March 10, 1945, at the end of World War II.\n\n Occupation years to Chūshingura: 1946–1962 \n Early postwar work (1946–1954) \nEven though Toho was unaffected by the Tokyo bombings, as the company was located in Seijo, the amount of film productions was reduced due to the Occupation of Japan. Because of this, the company produced only eighteen films in 1946, with Tsuburaya working on eight of them. During the same year, Tsuburaya became head of the special effects production department at Toho and established its cinematography, compositing, art, and development units. Since he and his effects unit at the company had a minor slate of films to work on, they also began testing matte painting and optical printing.\n\nToho was on the verge of disbandment due to the three major labor disputes that occurred at the studio during the late 1940s. According to Akira Tsuburaya, his father had to sneak around the Japanese police and U.S. tanks deployed during these strikes and disputes in order to get to work. To repel the police, the labor strikers erected a barricade, using a large fan, made by the special effects department of the company, which was equipped with the Zero fighter engine that Tsuburaya had used during the war. These events led to the creation of Shintoho; Tsuburaya would create the effects for the studio's first film, A Thousand and One Nights with Toho (1947).\n\nIn late March 1948, Tsuburaya was purged from Toho by the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers because of his involvement in propaganda films during World War II. The U.S. occupation officials reportedly expelled him assuming he had access to classified documents when creating the comprehensive miniatures featured in The War at Sea from Hawaii to Malaya, which led them to inaccurately conclude that he was a spy. Consequently, Toho disbanded their special effects division and Tsuburaya, together with his son Hajime, founded the independent special effects company , an unofficial juridical entity. Henceforth, he worked at major film studios outside Toho without on-screen credit.\n\nleft|thumb|alt=A man unwraps the bandage covering his head to reveal that he is invisible|Tsuburaya's effects in The Invisible Man Appears (1949) were intended to be superior to those in Universal's The Invisible Man film series\nIn 1949, five major Daiei Film productions featuring effects directed by Tsuburaya were released to Japanese theaters: Japanese horror filmmaker Bin Kato's The White Haired Fiend, Keigo Kimura's Flowers of Raccoon Palace, Kiyohiko Ushihara's The Rainbow Man, Akira Nobuchi's The Ghost Train, and Nobuo Adachi's The Invisible Man Appears. This last movie was the first successful Japanese science fiction film, as well as the country's first adaption of H. G. Wells' novel The Invisible Man. Created by studying the eponymous 1933 film adaptation of Wells' novel, Daiei had intended this film to be Tsuburaya's full-scale post-war recovery, featuring special effects superior in quality to those in Universal Pictures' The Invisible Man film series. Tsuburaya, however, was disappointed with his lack of competence on the project and gave up his ambition to become a Daiei employee after The Invisible Man Appears was finished.\n\nIn 1950, Tsuburaya relocated some equipment and employees at Tsuburaya Special Technology Laboratory to Toho's headquarters; his independent company was merely the size of six tatami mats inside Toho Studios. In the same year, he continued to direct special effects for films from other companies, including Toyoko Eiga's anti-war film Listen to the Voices of the Sea. While slowly rebuilding the company's Special Arts Department, he filmed all of the title cards, trailers, and the logo for Toho's films from 1950 to 1954. The first production featuring major contributions by Tsuburaya upon his return to Toho was reportedly a 1950 film directed by Hiroshi Inagaki and based on the life of Japanese swordsman Sasaki Kojirō. During this period, Tsuburaya also worked on Toho films such as Senkichi Taniguchi's anti-war film Escape at Dawn (1950), directed the effects for Taniguchi's , staged miniature ships to depict a battle in Hiroshi Inagaki's , and directed the effects for Kenji Mizoguchi's The Lady of Musashino.\n\nIn February 1952, Tsuburaya's exile from public office was officially lifted. That same month, Ishirō Honda's second feature film, The Skin of the South, was released to Japanese theaters. Tsuburaya directed the film's effects for the typhoon and landslide scenes, which was his first experience acting as the effects director on a film by the future Godzilla director. Tsuburaya collaborated with Honda and producer Tomoyuki Tanaka on The Man Who Came to Port later that year: this marked the first time the trio, who are considered the creators of Godzilla, ever collaborated with one another.\n\nDuring World War II, Toho had begun researching 3D films and completed a 3D film process known as \"Tovision\". While the project had been abandoned, it was later revived when the 3D film Bwana Devil (1952) became a box office hit in the United States. Hence, the company produced its first 3D film, future Godzilla co-writer Takeo Murata's  (1953). It features cinematography by Tsuburaya, who shot the short film by using an interlocking camera. After the completion of The Sunday That Jumped Out, Murata discussed creating a kaiju film about a giant whale attacking Tokyo, which Tsuburaya devised the previous year. Tsuburaya, therefore, resubmitted the conception of this production to producer Iwao Mori. Although this project never materialized, elements of it were included in early drafts of Godzilla the following year.\n\nTsuburaya's next project, the war epic Eagle of the Pacific (1953), was his first significant partnership with Ishirō Honda. As the film featured many effects sequences from The War at Sea from Hawaii to Malaya, Tsuburaya used only a small crew to shoot its new effects. Upon its release, the film reportedly became Toho's first post-war production to gross over  (). The ensuing year, he and Honda collaborated on another war film, Farewell Rabaul, released to Japanese theaters in February 1954, to moderate box office success. His effects for this assignment were more advanced than the ones used for Eagle of the Pacific, since they featured many more of his technological approaches and syntheses. Because of the success of Eagle of the Pacific and Farewell Rabaul, Tomoyuki Tanaka believed Tsuburaya should make more tokusatsu films with Honda. Tsuburaya's next film would become Japan's first global hit and gain him international attention.\n\n International recognition (1954–1959) \n\nAfter failing to renegotiate with the Indonesian government for the production of In the Shadow of Glory, producer Tomoyuki Tanaka began to consider creating a giant monster (or kaiju) film, inspired by Eugène Lourié's The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms (1953) and the Daigo Fukuryū Maru incident. He believed that it would have considerable potential, due to the financial success of previous monster films and the impact of news generating nuclear fears. As a result, he wrote an outline for the project and pitched it to Iwao Mori. Following Tsuburaya's agreement to create its effects, Mori approved the production, eventually titled Godzilla, in mid-April 1954; filmmaker Ishirō Honda soon took over the directing duties. During preproduction, Tsuburaya considered using stop motion to depict the titular monster but, as stated by special effects crew member Fumio Nakadai, had to employ the \"costume method\" because he \"finally decided it wouldn't work\". This technique is now known as \"suitmation\".\n\nTsuburaya's special effects department filmed Godzilla in 71 days from August to late October 1954, on a budget of . He and his crew worked relentlessly, regularly starting at 9:00 a.m., preparing at 5:00 p.m., and finishing the shoot at 4 or 5 a.m. in the following morning. Upon its nationwide release on November 3, Tsuburaya's effects received critical acclaim and the film became a box office hit. As a result, Godzilla established Toho as the most successful effects company in the world, and Tsuburaya obtained his first Japan Technical Award for his efforts.\n\nInstantly after completing Godzilla in October, Tsuburaya began working on another Toho-produced science fiction film, The Invisible Avenger, which was released to Japanese theaters in December 1954, under the title Invisible Man. This tokusatsu production was directed by Motoyoshi Oda and featured special effects and photography by Tsuburaya. For the movie, he inherited and expanded the technology used in his first film to feature an invisible character, The Invisible Man Appears (1949). Tsuburaya instructed his crew to portray the title character's invisibility in various ways throughout the film, including optical synthesis, and suggested that the character would disguise his invisibility powers by dressing up as a clown.\n\nthumb|left|Tsuburaya instructs Godzilla suit actor Haruo Nakajima on the set of Godzilla Raids Again (1955)\nDue to the enormous box-office success of Godzilla, Toho quickly gathered the majority of the crew behind the film to create a smaller-budget sequel to the film, entitled Godzilla Raids Again: Tsuburaya was officially given the title of special effects director for the first time, having always been credited under \"special technique\" beforehand. Shot in less than three months, the film was released in April 1955. Just a month later, Tsuburaya began directing the effects of Half Human, his second kaiju film collaboration with director Ishirō Honda. Among his efforts on this film, the effects director notably created stop-motion animation, rear-screen miniature, and miniature avalanche sequences.\n\nIn April 1956, Godzilla became the first Japanese film to be widely distributed throughout the United States and was later released worldwide, leading Tsuburaya to gain international recognition. However, for its American release, the movie was re-entitled as Godzilla, King of the Monsters!, heavily re-edited, and integrated with new footage featuring Canadian actor Raymond Burr.\n\nTsuburaya's next major undertaking, The Legend of the White Serpent, a Hong Kong-Japanese film adaptation of a novel by Fusao Hayashi based on the Chinese legend of the White Snake, was Toho's first tokusatsu production to be completely filmed in technicolor (via Eastmancolor). In preparation for the film, which was produced on a then-record budget of , Tsuburaya and his unit spent a month training with color process technology before shooting the effects. After working on The Legend of the White Serpent, Tsuburaya made the renowned Toho logo, and his unit created the opening credits for most of the company's films. Between working on large-scale Toho films, he also created the effects for Nippon TV's series Ninja Arts of Sanada Castle and several theatrical productions for Tokyo Takarazuka Theater.\n\nToho's next assignment for Tsuburaya was Rodan, the first kaiju film ever produced in color. About 60% of Rodan'''s  budget was spent on Tsuburaya's effects, which included optical animation, matte paintings, and extremely elaborate miniature sets created to be destroyed or flown over by its namesake monster (played by original Godzilla suit actor Haruo Nakajima). Rodan required a large number of model sets in a variety of sizes, including 1/10, 1/20, 1/25, and 1/30, to be developed and assembled by Tsuburaya's division. The film premiered in Japanese theaters in December 1956 and, upon its release in the United States the following year, earned more at the box office than any previous science fiction film.Throne of Blood, an adaptation of William Shakespeare's Macbeth from renowned filmmaker Akira Kurosawa, was Tsuburaya's second film release of 1957. Kurosawa cut several scenes by Tsuburaya due to his displeasure with the amount of footage he made for Throne of Blood. He next served as the special effects director for The Mysterians, a science fiction epic directed by Ishirō Honda. The first color CinemaScope film ever directed by the duo, The Mysterians is often called the \"definitive science fiction movie\". Tsuburaya won another Japan Technical Award for his widescreen effects in The Mysterians.\n\nA new sub-genre for Toho was born with Tsuburaya's first movie of 1958, The H-Man, which was the first entry in the \"Transforming Human Series\". He next directed the effects for Honda's Varan the Unbelievable, a film about a giant monster awakened in the Tōhoku mountains that surfaces in Tokyo Bay. Initially planned as a made-for-television film, co-produced between Toho and the American company AB-PT Pictures, the production was plagued by numerous difficulties: AB-PT collapsed during production, leading Toho to alter the film's status to a theatrical feature. Tsuburaya's final film released in 1958 was Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress.\n\nTsuburaya began 1959 by working on the special effects for Mighty Atom, a tokusatsu television series based on Osamu Tezuka's manga series Astro Boy. Although neither he nor his company were credited in the show itself when it aired between March 7, 1959, and May 28, 1960, he supervised the miniature photography done by his staff at Tsuburaya Special Technology Laboratory. Around the same time, Tsuburaya also directed the special effects for a storm sequence featured in Honda's Inao: Story of an Iron Arm, for which he also constructed the miniature for the title character's rowboat. Next, he worked on Monkey Sun, co-written and directed by Kajirō Yamamoto as an all-star remake of his 1940 film Son Gokū, a previous entry in the effects director's curriculum. Taking inspiration from watching soybean paste in the broth of his wife's miso soup, Tsuburaya created scenes with storm clouds, as well as smoke and ash erupting from three volcanoes. His effects for Monkey Sun were described by biographer August Ragone as \"comical and surreal\".\n\nAfter operating on the Tokyo Takarazuka Theater production The Story of Bali, he directed the effects for Shūe Matsubayashi's Submarine I-57 Will Not Surrender, his first war film in six years. In order to film submarine scenes for the film, a model seabed terrain was built in the first Toho miniature pool (dubbed the \"Small Pool\" after a bigger stage was completed). He also filmed his effects for a technicolor version of the film, but they were converted to black-and-white for the final version. In August 1959, Tsuburaya, together with his sons Hajime and Noboru, shot footage of two dragon puppets in Tsuburaya's laboratory at their house in Setagaya, Tokyo for a Hong Kong-based film company.\n\nthumb|right|Tsuburaya with the Yamata no Orochi prop on the set of The Three Treasures (1959)\nTsuburaya's following significant production, director Hiroshi Inagaki's big-budget religious epic The Three Treasures, was created as Toho's celebratory thousandth film. Based on legends featured in the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, it stars Toshiro Mifune as Yamato Takeru and the kami Susanoo. The effects director and his crew shot several key sequences included in the film, such as a battle between Mifune's character Susanoo and the eight-headed dragon Yamata no Orochi and an eruption of Mount Fuji. On The Three Treasures, Tsuburaya used for the first time the \"Toho Versatile Process\", an adaptation of Toho's optical printing process that he developed on a budget of  for widescreen color films and revealed in May of the same year. The movie earned over , against an initial  budget, ranking as Toho's highest-grossing film of the year and their second-highest-grossing film altogether. He won the Japan Technical Award for Special Skill and was presented with the Special Achievement Award at Movie Day. While he was pleased with the success of The Three Treasures, Tsuburaya became disappointed after seeing a picture of the heads of the Yamata no Orochi prop held up by piano wires in a newspaper article concerning its special effects. Accordingly, he declined an interview with the newspaper because he believed the photograph \"broke children's dreams\".\n\nWhen the Space Race erupted between the U.S. and the Soviet Union in the late 1950s, Tsuburaya counseled Toho to produce a film about a lunar expedition. Therefore, his next film, Battle in Outer Space, was a science fiction epic about a group of astronauts who battle extraterrestrials on the surface of the Moon. Tsuburaya reportedly paid homage to producer George Pal's Destination Moon (1950) in the film's Moon landing sequence; he would later meet Pal in Los Angeles in 1962. Since films featuring his contributions were attaining global popularity and praise for Japanese cinema, Hearst filmed Tsuburaya directing the effects for Battle in Outer Space, and he later received the Special Award of Merit at the fourth  ceremony prior to its release.\n\n From The Secret of the Telegian to Chūshingura (1960–1962) \nright|thumb|Tsuburaya holding a miniature pilot's ejector seat, \nA smaller-scale science fiction film, entitled The Secret of the Telegian, which was Toho's second installment in the Transforming Human Series, marked Tsuburaya's first assignment of 1960. He then took on a project of a much larger extent, Storm Over the Pacific, the first-ever war film in color. His department created notably large miniatures for the film, with a 13-meter long miniature being filmed by Tsuburaya on the Miura Coast. Storm Over the Pacific was also Toho's first film to require the use of the \"Big Pool\", which had been completed in February 1960. The pool would later be used in the production of every Godzilla film, before being demolished at the end of the filming process for Godzilla: Final Wars (2004). Storm Over the Pacific obtained critical acclaim upon its release, with numerous of Tsuburaya's effects sequences being later featured in Midway (1976), a film by Jack Smight that was also about the Pacific War. Throughout the rest of 1960, Tsuburaya worked on other notable productions, such as the third film in the Transforming Human Series, The Human Vapor; he also oversaw the creation of an extremely detailed miniature of Osaka Castle and directed its destruction scene for Hiroshi Inagaki's jidaigeki film The Story of Osaka Castle, and then directed the tsunami sequence in the film adaptation of Pearl S. Buck's 1948 novel The Big Wave.\n\nthumb|left|upright|Tsuburaya and the special effects crew preparing the miniature Tokyo Tower for Mothra's attack scene in Mothra (1961)\nIn 1961, Tsuburaya directed the effects for Mothra, another kaiju film created in collaboration with Ishirō Honda. Allegedly inspired by his own dreams, Tsuburaya created the eponymous giant, moth-like kaiju, which would go on to become one of the icons of Japanese fantasy cinema, alongside Godzilla and Rodan, and appear in numerous films thereafter. Though the overall budget for Mothra allowed the effects department to create the largest-scale miniature set ever constructed for a Toho production, Tsuburaya was displeased with some of the sequences shot for the film, including some composite cuts of the Shobijin. Nonetheless, he decided to keep these scenes upon editing Mothra in post-production. The film was released on July 30, 1961, becoming a massive box office hit and, as stated by biographer August Ragone, an \"instant classic\" alongside Honda and Tsuburaya's earlier kaiju films Godzilla and Rodan.\n\nAfter directing blue screen dream scenes with actor Toshiro Mifune for Hiroshi Inagaki's film  (1961), Tsuburaya moved on to direct the effects for Shūe Matsubayashi's  epic tokusatsu film The Last War, which emerged as a major hit upon its October 1961 release, with Tsuburaya's effects receiving critical acclaim. The effects director himself would later list The Last War as one of his \"masterpieces\". Producer Tomoyuki Tanaka, assured from the box office success of Mothra and The Last War, gave Honda and Tsuburaya their greatest budget yet and 300 days to shoot Gorath, their next science fiction epic. Although Gorath is considered to feature some of Tsuburaya's best work as a special effects director, it was a box office failure when it was released in March 1962. On May 15, the director appeared on NK Educational TV's program Japanese Standards; in July, he finished directing the effects for , a South Korean-produced film that was never released in Japan.\n\nAfter filming Gorath, Tsuburaya began planning to work on other projects, such as a new version of Princess Kaguya. However, he postponed those as soon as he was given the opportunity to direct the special effects for Honda's crossover film King Kong vs. Godzilla. The script's early drafts were sent back with notes from Toho asking for the monster antics to be as \"funny as possible\"; Tsuburaya embraced this approach, seeking to emotionally appeal to children and expand the genre's audience. Many of the sequences for the battle between the two monsters were purposefully filled with humorous details, but the approach was not favored by most of the effects crew, who \"couldn't believe\" some of the things Tsuburaya asked them to do, such as Kong and Godzilla volleying a giant boulder back and forth. For their portrayals, Tsuburaya gave Haruo Nakajima (playing Godzilla) and Shoichi Hirose (playing King Kong) freedom to choreograph their own moves. Tsuburaya directed sequences at a miniature outdoor set on the Miura Coast, which depicted the giant octopus's attack on the Faro Island village. During its original theatrical release in August 1962, King Kong vs. Godzilla became the second-highest-grossing Japanese film in history and was watched by 11.2 million people, leading it to be regarded as the most-attended film in the Godzilla series.\n\nTsuburaya's final film release of 1962 was Inagaki's epic jidaigeki film Chūshingura: Hana no Maki, Yuki no Maki, for which he and his department made forced perspective stages and various optical effects. Produced by Toho—like King Kong vs. Godzilla—in celebration of their 30th anniversary, Chūshingura was the company's fourth highest-grossing film of the year, and their tenth-highest altogether.\n\nBirth of a company to last years: 1963–1970\nBirth of a company and career expansion (1963–1964)\nThe first movie released in 1963 to feature Tsuburaya's contributions was another war film by Shūe Matsubayashi, Attack Squadron!, distributed in January of that year. Despite not being an epic film, unlike Toho's previous war movies, Attack Squadron! still featured several miniature Japanese and American aircraft, crafted by Tsuburaya's crew, with some of the models being controlled via radio control. The sole new miniature battleship built for the film was Yamato, an enormous motorized model constructed at 1/15 scale and measuring 17.5 meters (or 57.5 feet).\n\nthumb|The Tsuburaya family and employee Tetsuo Kinjō celebrating the foundation of Tsuburaya Productions. Left to right: Hajime, Kinjō, Eiji, Masano, Noboru, Tomoko (Noboru's spouse), and Akira.\nAfter visiting Hollywood in order to study the special effects work of major American studios, Tsuburaya founded his own independent company, Tsuburaya Special Effects Productions (later called simply Tsuburaya Productions), on April 12, 1963. It was initially handled entirely by his family: Tsuburaya was reported as its director general and president; his wife Masano was on the director's board; his second son Noboru was appointed as accountant. Hajime, Tsuburaya's eldest son, would soon join the company as well, leaving his award-winning directorial employment at the Tokyo Broadcasting System. Around August of the same year, photography assistant Kiyoshi Suzuki was hired alongside , a former news cameraman for Kyodo Television. Takano was directly involved in Tsuburaya Productions' first-ever full-scale tokusatsu production, Alone Across the Pacific (1963), which required twenty-five effects sequences. Throughout the rest of the year, Tsuburaya worked both for his new company and Toho, where he was still at the helm of the effects department, despite having terminated his exclusive deal with the company.\n\nThe second film released in 1963 to feature his contributions was Li Han-hsiang's Hong Kong musical film The Love Eterne. The effects director was tasked to stage the scene where an earthquake split the tomb of the character Liang Shanbo (played by Ivy Ling Po) in two and the protagonist (played by Betty Loh Ti) ascended into heaven. Cinematographer Tadashi Nishimoto traveled to Japan in order to film Tsuburaya's effects at Shintoho's . Thereafter, the special effects director moved on to the World War I adventure film . In his first partnership with director , Tsuburaya's division developed several new models for the film, including large-scale miniatures, full-scale replications of early twentieth-century flying vehicles, and an enormous outdoor model set of Fort Bismarck. According to Ragone, Tsuburaya enjoyed working on this film, despite aiming to make his own tribute feature to Japanese aviation pioneers.\n\nShortly after completing The Siege of Fort Bismarck in April 1963, he began pre-production work on Matango, another film created in cooperation with Ishirō Honda, which was the final entry in the Transforming Human Series. In contrast with the majority of Toho's previous monster-themed films, the actors were capable of psychical interaction with the suit actors portraying the monsters on a sound stage.  said that Tsuburaya \"focused\" Toho to purchase the \"Optical Printer 1900 Series\" in order to facilitate the production of special effects, while noting that optical synthesis technology became popular following the film's release. A box office failure upon its Japanese release, Matango was not included in Kinema Junpos list of height-grossing films for the year, and has been considered as one of Honda and Tsuburaya's most obscure movies ever since, being deemed as a \"virtually unknown film\".\n\nTsuburaya soon moved on to film miniatures and produce optical animation (via his newly purchased Optical Printer 1900 Series) for The Lost World of Sinbad. This film, directed by Senkichi Taniguchi from a screenplay by Mothra and King Kong vs. Godzilla writer Shinichi Sekizawa, included an acclaimed choreographed chase sequence between a wizard and a witch, created via animation and matte photography, which gained Tsuburaya another Japan Technical Award for Special Skill.\n\nleft|thumb|Tsuburaya with a prop used to portray the Mu empire's guardian sea dragon Manda on the set of Atragon, 1963\nTsuburaya almost immediately started to work on another Honda-directed science fiction tokusatsu movie, Atragon (1963). Based on Shunrō Oshikawa's novel The Undersea Warship and incorporated with Shigeru Komatsuzaki's novel Undersea Empire, the film concerns a group of former colleagues, friends, and family that must convince the captain of the battleship Gotengo, Hachiro Jinguji (played by Jun Tazaki), to use his battleship to save the world from the invading ancient undersea civilization of Mu, who are using their advanced technology and their guardian sea dragon, Manda, in an attempt to take over the surface world. Since Toho aimed to distribute the film in Japanese theaters on December 22 of that year, Tsuburaya was given roughly two months to shoot the effects sequences for Atragon. As a result, in order to achieve the company's goal, he separated his special effects team into two units, assuring that it would allow him to complete the assignment as soon as possible. Although it was quickly converted and developed, the film is regarded as \"one of the cornerstones of Japanese cinema\" and is still often referenced in media.\n\nWhile working on Atragon, Tsuburaya was also concluding model effects for the Hiroshi Inagaki-directed jidaigeki film, Whirlwind (1964). During this period of time, lack of sleep and workload-related stress were taking a toll on Tsuburaya's health, so much that he was often found sleeping in his chair during scene set-ups for his effects shoots.\n\nThe fourth installment in the Godzilla movie series, Mothra vs. Godzilla (1964), was Tsuburaya's next project. Often regarded as the best kaiju film to feature his works, it was produced in celebration of the tenth-anniversary of Toho's kaiju films and depicts the battle between Godzilla and the title character of the 1961 film Mothra. Tsuburaya utilized his 1900 optical printer to remove damage in composite photographs for the picture and create Godzilla's atomic breath; he also went on location to shoot some composite plates of Nagoya Castle for the scene where Godzilla destroyed the building. Since Godzilla actor Haruo Nakajima could not destroy the castle's model entirely, as originally planned, Tsuburaya first attempted to salvage the shot by making Godzilla seem enraged by the castle's strong fortification, before eventually choosing to re-shoot the scene with a more fragile model. He also went on location to shoot a segment featuring the United States Navy discharging missiles at Godzilla: this scene was included in the movie's version for the U.S. market, whereas it was omitted from the original Japanese version. This was one of the rare occasions when a sequence featuring Godzilla was shot outside Toho Studios.\n\nJapanese-American coproductions and Ultra Q (1964–1965)\nthumb|Tsuburaya (far left, with glasses) talks with Frank Sinatra (center) during the filming of the dogfight scene in None but the Brave (1965)\nIn the spring of 1964, Tsuburaya received a visit from frequent collaborator Ishirō Honda on the Hawaiian Island of Kauai. The effects director was shooting a dogfight and plane crash sequence for Frank Sinatra's None but the Brave (released in 1965), the renowned singer and actor's sole directorial picture. As the first major Japanese-American co-production, the epic anti-war film revolved around a troop of American soldiers, stranded in the middle of the Pacific Ocean during World War II, who are forced to collaborate with an opposition Japanese unit that has also been stranded on the same island. During Honda's visit, Tsuburaya told him he was working on his first television series for Tsuburaya Productions, then-titled Unbalance, but was struggling to find a lead actor for it. Honda convinced Kenji Sahara (who starred in None but the Brave and several Honda-Tsuburaya kaiju films) to play the team leader for the intended show, which would later become Ultra Q (1966). None but the Brave was later released in Japan by Toho on January 15, 1965, and was distributed by Warner Bros. in the U.S. the following month.\n\nIn January 1964, while in New York, Tsuburaya ordered Oxberry's 1200 optical printer, a model that at the time was owned by only one other studio in the entire world: Disney. Despite having to spend a then-record  fee, Tsuburaya wanted to purchase the new printer for Tsuburaya Productions because it was one of the most adaptable post-production tools: moreover, he had used Oxberry's previous iteration of the device on films such as Matango. He went on to operate this technology on Ultra Q, Tsuburaya Productions' first television series, which was a combination of two of his previously discarded projects, tentatively titled Unbalance and WoO. Principal photography on Ultra Q began on September 27, 1964, with the shooting of the episode \"Mammoth Flower\". Airing on the Tokyo Broadcasting System from January 2 to July 3, 1966, the series follows the adventures of a trio who investigates strange phenomena, ranging from supernatural threats to kaiju, in the 20th century. Upon broadcast, around 30% of Japanese households with televisions watched the show, making Tsuburaya a household name and gaining him even more attention from the media, who dubbed him the \"God of Tokusatsu\".\n\nAfter directing the effects on Honda's kaiju film Dogora (released in August 1964), Tsuburaya renewed their collaboration for the kaiju film, Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster, making 1964 the only time two Godzilla movies were ever released in the same year (the first one being Mothra vs. Godzilla). Conceived as one of the features celebrating ten years of Toho's kaiju films, Ghidorah featured a dragon kaiju designed as an homage to Yamata no Orochi, King Ghidorah, who opposed Godzilla, Rodan, and Mothra in the film. Tsuburaya and Toho executives decided to anthropomorphize the monsters for the film, despite Honda feeling \"uncomfortable\" with the decision and being reluctant to use The Peanuts (who previously played Mothra's fairies in the namesake film) as the interpreters for the kaiju in the summit scene. Released on December 20, 1964, Ghidorah was a massive box office hit, grossing , relatively more than King Kong vs. Godzilla, the series' previous record holder. King Ghidorah would go on to become a frequent antagonist of the Godzilla franchise.\n\nTsuburaya began 1965 by directing the effects for Seiji Maruyama's war film Retreat from Kiska. Tsuburaya spent two months filming the scene where the fleet circles Kiska Island in thick fog on an indoor stage set since the fog could not be controlled by the wind during open shooting. The sequence where the fleet slips through the rocks was realized by laying a rail at the bottom of the special effects pool and running the warship's miniature on it. The miniatures could not be very large for on-set shooting, and the water flow was pumped to adjust the proportions of the waves and wakes. A large outdoor pool is used in the scene of port entry and departure without fog. For his work on Kiska, Tsuburaya won a Japan Technical Award for Special Skill at the 19th Japan Technical Awards.\n\nthumb|upright|left|Tsuburaya (left) with Frankenstein actor Kōji Furuhata (right) on the set of Frankenstein vs. Baragon (1965)\nHis next production, Frankenstein vs. Baragon (1965), depicted Frankenstein's monster fighting a new subterranean kaiju, named Baragon in Japan.  Tsuburaya was reportedly enthusiastic about working on the film because the titular monsters were going to be smaller than normal, allowing his team to build larger model sets than the ones used in Godzilla movies: plus, an actor in make-up—Kōji Furuhata—would be involved to play Frankenstein, rather than leaving the role to a stuntman in a monster suit. In spite of featuring model sets among the biggest and most detailed models for a Honda-Tsuburaya collaboration, some critics have questioned several of Tsuburaya's ideas, including a puppet used to portray a horse, instead of an actual equine, for a sequence in which Baragon overruns a farmstead. According to Koichi Takano, Tsuburaya said that he used the puppet because it was \"more fun\". Tsuburaya also made a scene depicting the atomic bomb falling upon Hiroshima, which Honda biographers Steve Ryfle and Ed Godziszewski called an \"impressionistic display of smoke and fire\".\n\nAfter post-production on the film was finalized for its Japanese release, held two days after the twentieth anniversary of the Hiroshima atomic bombing (August 8, 1965), American co-producer Henry G. Saperstein asked for Toho to film a new ending for the U.S. version: Tsuburaya and Honda, accordingly, re-assembled the cast and crew to shoot the new ending, although it was eventually left unused in both American and Japanese iterations of the motion picture. Still, the alternative ending was later screened at a fan convention in 1982, before featuring as a bonus scene on home video.\n\nFollowing Frankenstein vs. Baragon, Tsuburaya quickly moved on to his next film, Kengo Furusawa's The Crazy Adventure, produced in celebration of the tenth anniversary of the Crazy Cats comedy group. Inspired by popular spy films of the time, Tsuburaya's department extensively used \"wire action\" in outdoor locations, while lead actor Hitoshi Ueki performed most of the movie's action sequences without any stunts. Tsuburaya also directed miniature effects sequences for the film. Released in Japan on October 31, 1965, The Crazy Adventure was another box office hit for Tsuburaya, earning even more than Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster.\n\nthumb|Tsuburaya directs Haruo Nakajima (in Godzilla suit) on the set of Invasion of Astro-Monster (1965)\nThen, Tsuburaya worked on Honda's Invasion of Astro-Monster (1965), the sixth film in the Godzilla franchise and Shōwa period, as well as the second collaboration between Toho and UPA. A direct sequel to Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster, the movie focuses on two astronauts who land on a planet occupied by an alien race, known as the \"Xiliens\", as they ask humanity for assistance with Godzilla and Rodan in defeating the \"intruder\" King Ghidorah. After bringing the astronauts, scientist Sakurai, Godzilla, and Rodan to their planet, the aliens attempt to exploit Ghidorah, Godzilla, and Rodan to conquer the Earth by mind-controlling them. The last Godzilla film to feature the contributions of Tsuburaya's entire effects unit, Invasion of Astro-Monster notably features Godzilla's renowned victory dance, which derived from the shie! dance featured in Fujio Akatsuka's comedy manga series Osomatsu-kun (1962–1969), a popular culture sensation at the time of the film's production. The dance was included in the film after a Toho employee suggested it to Tsuburaya, who was already supportive of anthropomorphizing monster characters with comical characteristics. For his work on Invasion of Astro-Monster, the director obtained the Japan Technical Award for Special Skill the following year.\n\nUltraman and beyond (1966–1967)\nAt the height of Ultra Q's popularity, TBS aired \"The Father of Ultra Q\", an episode of their documentary series Modern Leaders, on June 2, 1966. Throughout the episode, Tsuburaya was filmed at work and elsewhere, being even interviewed by individuals dressed in Ultra Q monster costumes: in this instance, he mentioned for the first time that he was working on a new show to follow Ultra Q, which later turned out to be Ultraman.\n\nTsuburaya had begun working on the new tokusatsu series in the autumn of the previous year: TBS executives wanted to produce a series as thriving as Ultra Q and wanted a full-color program that would \"take the monster line to the next level\". Tsuburaya and writer Tetsuo Kinjō decided to take the barebones concept of Ultra Q about civilians and scientists haggling monsters: they came up with the idea of a group, tentatively named the \"Scientific Investigation Agency\" (SIA), formed to deal with kaiju and supernatural phenomena as the focus of the new show. The pair also agreed to add unused conceptions from Ultra Q and WoO. Tsuburaya had spent significant amounts of studio money to build his models for the Godzilla films, so TBS aimed to monetize these miniatures and was looking for a task that could repurpose the sets and suits from the Godzilla franchise.\n\nthumb|upright|left|Tsuburaya with actor Bin Furuya (in Ultraman suit), \nDuring designing, Tsuburaya found the original versions of title character's design to be \"too alien and sinister\", and requested production designer Tohl Narita to keep drafting additional designs as teleplays were being written concurrently. Narita chose to root Ultraman's design in the Greek concept of cosmos (order and harmony), in contrast to his previous designs for Ultra Q, which had been inspired by the concept of khaos. Tsuburaya provided input on Narita's designs, with some being inspired by the art of Miyamoto Musashi. Ultraman's silver skin symbolized steel from an interstellar rocket, while the red lining represented the surface of Mars. As stated by biographer August Ragone, Ultraman became Tsuburaya's \"most popular and enduring creation\".\n\nThe filming sessions for Ultraman began in March 1966, and the crew was divided into three separate groups for its live-action and special effects. Tsuburaya Productions and TBS initially planned to start broadcasting the series on July 17, 1966, but the latter company chose to release it the week before. Tsuburaya supervised the production of every episode of the series and served as the de facto special effects director for episodes 18 and 19.\n\nAfter a few meetings between the two companies and sponsors, it was decided that a pilot episode, originally planned as the \"Ultraman Eve Festival\", would introduce the show's title character. The pilot episode was aired on July 10—one of the dates that have been cited as Tsuburaya's birthday— of that same year, under the title The Birth of Ultraman: An Ultraman Premiere Celebration. Ultraman became a larger hit than its predecessor, obtaining a 40% viewership. With monsters now available to watch at home weekly, children fewer asked their parents to take them to the theater: consequently, Tsuburaya Productions' triumph in television was diverting box-office money from Toho's kaiju films.\n\nAlso in 1966, Tsuburaya worked once again with Honda for the kaiju film The War of the Gargantuas, produced in collaboration with Henry G. Saperstein, which centered on scientists investigating the appearance of two giant hairy humanoids who eventually fight each other in Tokyo. Initially drafted as a sequel to Frankenstein vs. Baragon, the film went through several tentative titles during scripting, and the final film was referred to by film chronicler Stuart Galbraith IV as a \"quasi–sequel\" to its predecessor. The film premiered in Japan in July 1966.\n\nAfter Tsuburaya's series Booska the Friendly Beast began airing on television in November 1966, he received his last credit as \"special effects director\" on a Godzilla film for Ebirah, Horror of the Deep. However, his disciple  actually served as a de facto special effects director for this film, with Tsuburaya's credit being merely ceremonial. The following year, Tsuburaya directed the effects for King Kong Escapes, a Japanese-American co-production created to celebrate Toho's thirty-fifth anniversary. In homage to the dinosaur fighting scene from King Kong (1933), the director introduced Gorosaurus, a dinosaurian kaiju that battles Kong on Mondo Island in the film. The ensuing 1967 release featuring Tsuburaya's contributions was Ultraseven, the third entry in the Ultra series, which had been influenced by the British TV series Thunderbirds. The series received a 33.7% rating upon beginning airing on October 7, 1967. Also in 1967, he was appointed \"special effects supervisor\" and handed over the position of special effects director for the Godzilla film series to Arikawa, starting with Son of Godzilla.\n\nFinal works, last years, and death (1968–1970)\nIn 1967, Tsuburaya Productions' writing crew took elements from Shinichi Sekizawa's screenplay, The Flying Battleship, and inserted concepts from it into a TV series, Mighty Jack, which was similar in concept to James Bond and Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea. Concerning a team of secret agents established by a prosperous industrialist to oppose the acts of a military organization, referred to as \"Q\", Mighty Jack was aimed at a more mature audience, in contrary to the Ultra series and Booska the Friendly Beast. Due to pressure from Fuji TV, the series declined rapidly after the release of its first episode on April 6, 1968, as a consequence of its poor quality: many teleplays were filmed without revision, effects work frequently lacked time, and reshoots were often unattainable. Fuji TV considered the series as a commercial failure, due to its 8.3% audience rating, and they canceled it after Tsuburaya Productions had finished producing just 13 of the scheduled 26 episodes. A sequel to the series, titled Fight! Mighty Jack, later began broadcasting in July 1968.\n\nWith budgets rising, less returning crew, and theatergoers being dragged away by television, producer Tomoyuki Tanaka chose to conclude the Godzilla series but offered one last film for the original staff. Honda's consequential kaiju epic, Destroy All Monsters (1968), featured effects directed by Sadamasa Arikawa, which Tsuburaya allegedly supervised. His next release of that year was another Seiji Maruyama's war epic, Admiral Yamamoto, which starred Toshiro Mifune as Imperial Japanese Navy Marshal Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto (who was previously the topic of Honda and Tsuburaya's Eagle of the Pacific). Destroy All Monsters was the twelfth-highest grossing domestic film of 1968, registering an approximately -worth gain, while Admiral Yamamoto was the second-highest grosser, at roughly . On September 15, 1968, the week after the final episode of Ultraseven was broadcast and just over a month after Admiral Yamamoto was distributed to Japanese theaters by Toho, the director's following project for Tsuburaya Productions, , began airing on the TBS, where he served as the show's supervisor.Latitude Zero, released by Toho in July 1969, was a Japanese-American collaboration produced by Toho and Don Sharp Productions. The production was reported to have had a budget of  (equivalent to about ), but Tsuburaya's department had difficulty making realistic creatures for the picture after its American producer pulled out of the project. In comparison, retrospective writers have praised Tsuburaya's model work, especially his submarines, which Ryfle and Godziszewski noted resembled Thunderbirds machines in Gerry Anderson's show of the same name. Like Honda and Tsuburaya's previous effort, Latitude Zero only grossed  (), making it a box office failure.\n\nTsuburaya quickly moved on to his next project, Battle of the Japan Sea, regarded as the third film in the \"Toho 8.15 series\" (following Japan's Longest Day and Admiral Yamamoto). Tsuburaya was provided with his largest budget ever for the Seiji Maruyama-directed war epic film about the Russo-Japanese War. Thus, 60 members of his department's artists created an estimated 107 ship miniatures for the film and constructed a 13-meter model replica of the Imperial Japanese Navy's battleship Mikasa, in contrast to the other 3-meter ships. Released in August 1969, Battle of the Japan Sea was the second highest Japanese grosser of 1969, earning  against its  budget. Deemed one of Tsuburaya's masterpieces, Battle of the Japan Sea was the last production he officially took part in as the special effects director. On the same month, Tsuburaya Productions' next series, Horror Theater Unbalance (aired in 1973), entered the production process: Tsuburaya was credited as its supervisor.\n\nTsuburaya and several of Toho's effects crew members spent the majority of 1969 working together to create Birth of the Japanese Islands, an audiovisual exhibit simulating earthquakes and volcanoes, which was set to be part of Mitsubishi's pavilion at the Expo '70 in Suita, Osaka Prefecture. His commitment to the project prevented him from being involved in the production of All Monsters Attack (1969), and director Honda handled special effects instead of him for the first time. Nonetheless, the director stated that Tsuburaya was \"personally involved with the editing,\" adding: \"The film may have been generally put together [by others], but he definitely looked it over and instructed the staff to shorten certain scenes, and so on.\"\n\nthumb|Tsuburaya's grave at the Catholic Cemetery in Fuchū, Tokyo|321x301px\nIgnoring his doctor's recent advice to reduce his workload due to declining health, Tsuburaya started displaying symptoms of unstable angina, and he collapsed while visiting the Naruto whirlpools during the shooting sessions for the Expo '70 film presentation. He was subsequently sent to  in Meguro to continue his recovery, but refused to remain there, as he expected to complete Birth of the Japanese Islands on schedule: instead, he accepted an offer to recover and receive medical treatment at Ukiyama Villa on the Izu Peninsula in Itō, Shizuoka, where he was instructed to cancel any assignments. Concerned about Tsuburaya's future, his son Hajime quit his job at TBS and officially took over his father's position as the president of Tsuburaya Productions on November 30, 1969.\n\nIn December 1969, Tsuburaya completed filming the Expo '70 project and moved to his Ukiyama Villa with his wife Masano, where he persisted in writing his autobiography and the film outlines Japan Airplane Guy and Princess Kaguya. While continuing to write the Japan Airplane Guy story treatment daily, he expressed his desire to work on more projects in the future and return to Tokyo on January 26, 1970. However, on January 25, 1970, at 10:15 P.M., Masano awoke and discovered that Tsuburaya had died while sleeping with her at the villa in Itō, Shizuoka: he was 68 years old. Japanese sources have cited the cause of his death as angina associated with an asthma attack.\n\nOn January 27, a mourning tradition took place at the Tsuburaya family's house. His funeral was held at the Seijō Catholic Church on January 29, with his eldest son Hajime serving as the chief mourner. The following day, he was posthumously awarded the Honorary Chairman Award by the Japanese Society of Cinematographers and the Order of the Sacred Treasure by emperor Hirohito. A Catholic service was held at Toho Studios on February 2, with The Last War producer Sanezumi Fujimoto providing the services. Five hundred friends and colleagues attended the service, including actor Kazuo Hasegawa, The War at Sea from Hawaii to Malaya director Kajirō Yamamoto, The Three Treasures director Hiroshi Inagaki, and A Thousand and One Nights with Toho director Kon Ichikawa. He was later entombed at the Catholic Cemetery in Fuchū, Tokyo, Japan.\n\nFilmmaking\nStyle, themes, and techniques\nthumb|Tsuburaya directs his special effects crew on the set of Godzilla (1954). The film's namesake monster portrayed via \"suitmation\" (behind Tsuburaya) symbolizes nuclear holocaust.\nTsuburaya's career in film production evolved from small-scale jidaigeki films to financially successful war and science fiction epics. During his stint as a cinematographer in the early 20th century, Tsuburaya closely researched international cinema in order to incorporate some of the techniques and improve his innovative style; some of these films include: The Lost World (1925), Metropolis (1927), and King Kong (1933). Tsuburaya remarked that King Kong heavily influenced him to work in special effects. He decided to create special effects sequences in films by using miniature effects and synthesis technology involving layered film strips. Tsuburaya constantly converted new special effects techniques and tested them on a daily basis and became the founder and head of Japanese special effects (known as Tokusatsu), earning him the title \"Father of Tokusatsu\". Biographer August Ragone writes that his footage, which was always filmed live on a soundstage, in comparison to modern techniques such as computer-generated imagery, could be \"silly or deadly, beautiful or terrifying, but no matter how fanciful or fantastic, his visual effects seem to live and breathe with a life of their own.\"\n\nFor Godzilla (1954), Tsuburaya decided to create a new suit acting technique, later known as \"suitmation\", because the film's small budget and tight schedule restrained him from portraying Godzilla via stop motion (à la King Kong). Film historian Steve Ryfle writes that, although suitmation was not as elaborate as the stop motion techniques by effects pioneers Willis H. O'Brien (creator of the effects in King Kong) and Ray Harryhausen (creator of the effects in The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms), it gave the special effects director a more effective approach to depict the destruction sequences that made Godzilla famous.\n\nTsuburaya's endeavors in films often depicted nuclear holocausts, world wars, monster invasions, and intergalactic conflicts. Despite his movies featuring these apocalyptic and mass destructive themes, he opposed including themes of graphic violence—especially bleeding and slaughter—in his kaiju films, believing it was inappropriate for the younger members of the audience. However, Toho executives (such as Iwao Mori) urged Tsuburaya to feature gore in his kaiju films during the late 1960s, due to the rise in popularity of juvenile-targeted television shows that featured an increase in violent content, with even Tsuburaya's own shows Ultraman and Ultraseven depicting heroes decapitating, slashing, chopping, or otherwise injuring their monster adversaries. According to his protégé Teruyoshi Nakano, Tsuburaya told Toho executives: \"These movies are for kids. It's nonsense. Why do you enjoy showing them blood?\" Rather than have violent themes in his films, Tsuburaya continually employed lighthearted comedy and humanism in his tokusatsu work. As written by Ryfle, it is implied that this is due to him still being a \"child at heart\" and having a \"soft spot in his heart for children\" during his late life. In 1962, Tsuburaya explained: \"My heart and mind are as they were when I was a child. Then I loved to play with toys and to read stories of magic. I still do. My wish is only to make life happier and more beautiful for those who will go and see my films of fantasy.\" His compassion for children helped shape his legacy; notably, the Godzilla films produced after his death, featuring effects by Nakano, displayed large amounts of graphic violence.\n\nRelationship with cast and crew\nthumb|left|Tsuburaya (center) with director Ishirō Honda (right) and crew members on the Faro Island set of King Kong vs. Godzilla (1962)\nAccording to Ishirō Honda biographers Steve Ryfle and Ed Godziszewski, it was challenging to cooperate with Tsuburaya, especially for directors. Tsuburaya refused to surrender control of his sector to the mainstream director: he refused to allow directors to stare into the viewfinder in case they assessed elements like the set or camera position and opposed when his footage was re-edited. During the production of Godzilla (1954), however, Tsuburaya formed a bond with Honda, who had a completely different personality, being deemed as calm and courteous, rarely expressing his emotions towards others. Ryfle and Godziszewski stated that the two infrequently interacted outside Toho Studios and were not personal comrades, but nevertheless shared a \"tsu-ka relationship\". Honda's assistant director Kōji Kajita said that \"Other directors such as Hiroshi Inagaki, Jun Fukuda, and Shūe Matsubayashi also worked with Mr. Tsuburaya, but they were all the 'me-first' type and they really didn't work well together. Directors tend to think they are number one, and the effects team should just follow behind. Mr. Tsuburaya didn't appreciate that. Honda-san and Mr. Tsuburaya got along so well because they were both very mature men.\"\n\nDespite often making unrelenting directions on his crew, Tsuburaya was admired by colleagues, many of whom were younger than him and called him an \"uncle\", mentor, or the \"Old Man\". Godzilla suit actor Haruo Nakajima remarked that although Tsuburaya was usually smiling and had a refreshing disposition onset, he was often angry with the staff. Special effects cinematographer Tomioka Mototaka claimed he was in a position to be scolded by Tsuburaya against cinematographer Sadamasa Arikawa; photography assistants Takao Tsurumi and Mitsuru Chokai testified that Tsuburaya did not get angry directly when young individuals in his unit failed, but scolded Arikawa and others, instead.\n\nOn the contrary, Tsuburaya was rarely infuriated by actors. In an interview regarding August Ragone's biography on Tsuburaya, Nakajima said he was a \"very reserved man on the set. Most of the direction he gave me for the performances was, 'I trust you to do it. Do what you feel is best, I'll leave it up to you.' And that's the way he was for most of the films we worked on together after Godzilla.\" He added: \"After the wires broke on the Rodan suit, causing me to fall several meters onto the miniature set, he chided, 'It's good that you didn't die; because I need you to finish the film.'\" In an interview regarding Nezura 1964 (2020), Ultraman suit actor Bin Furuya remarked that Tsuburaya was \"usually a normal kind person\" and always encouraged his actors to \"act as if they were in the kind of film that would give dreams to children\".\n\nProduction and editing\nTsuburaya had several methods to shoot his films. During his stint as a cinematographer, he was the first to use crane shooting and key light prior to World War II. According to camera operator Mitsuo Miura, Tsuburaya also filmed \"pseudo nightscapes\" using beer bottle fragments as a filter, and his disciple Sadamasa Arikawa became the first photographer in Japan to shoot with color filters. During his late life, Tsuburaya explained to cinematographer Tomioka that he had always recognized how many frames could be taken with a hand-cranked camera, and he was able to turn it instinctively.\n\nHonda said that Tsuburaya's approach to film special effects was \"like a physics experiment, no different than trying to make new discoveries.\" Tsuburaya's lighting engineer Kaoru Saitō remarked that his camera work in special effects only moved sideways or moves up and down with a crane once the main position is decided, and the camera itself does not approach forward. Saitō also testified that he demanded the subject approach the camera and never shot the set from the other side of the camera.\n\nWhen he brainstormed ideas for a new film, Tsuburaya was known for his quiet but intense style. Nakano stated: \"I heard about this episode when Mr. Tsuburaya was returning home from work one day and he ran into this woman who kind of looked familiar to him. So he said, 'Hello, it's been a long time.' Do you know who that woman was? It was his wife! Mr. Tsuburaya was so deep into his own thoughts, he kind of lost himself sometimes.\"\n\nAccording to Arikawa, Tsuburaya also edited his own film work. Tsuburaya's assistant director, Masakatsu Asai, stated that he memorized the situation and storage location of the cuts he shot. Scripter Keiko Suzuki said Tsuburaya envisioned his own editing plan, and he often filmed scenes unscripted. Thus, for instance, scenes were altered from \"Battle 1\" to \"Aerial Battle 2\".\n\nLegacy\nCultural impact\n\nIn spite of his death, Tsuburaya's name and work remained prominent because his tokusatsu films and television shows generated a global fandom. A year after his death, Tsuburaya's intent to revitalize Ultraman was eventuated into Return of Ultraman (1971-1972), which launched a new string of the \"Ultra\" series throughout the rest of the decade. Despite having difficulty after their father's passing, Hajime, Noboru, and Akira kept running Tsuburaya Productions and never gave up his legacy, even when Tsuburaya Productions only had just three employees before the home video revived the Ultraman series. In 1989, Noboru declared that Ultraman is his father's \"most important legacy\" even if Godzilla is Tsuburaya's most popular character overseas.\n\nContemporary writers have frequently stated that Tsuburaya is one of the most influential figures in the history of cinema, with biographer August Ragone claiming that Tsuburaya's cinematic importance is on par with Akira Kurosawa. The Independent's Doug Bolton wrote that even \"people not familiar with Japanese science fiction will easily recognise  the legacy of Tsuburaya's work\". The Tokusatsu Network said that Tsuburaya was \"possibly the most influential figure in the Japanese film industry\" and stated that his legacy \"lives on to this day through his creations and has had a large enough impact for him to be compared to Walt Disney.\"\n\nNumerous people in the entertainment industry have spoken of their appreciation for Tsuburaya's work or cited it as an inspiration on their own work, including Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, Martin Scorsese, Brad Pitt, Quentin Tarantino, Stanley Kubrick, John Carpenter, Shinya Tsukamoto, Hideaki Anno, Will Smith, Chris Kirkpatrick, Guillermo del Toro, Shinji Higuchi, Shunji Iwai, Kazuo Miyagawa, and Attack on Titan creator Hajime Isayama. During the early 1970s, Lucas visited Toho when looking for a company to produce the special effects for Star Wars (1977) since Tsuburaya had established the company as a powerhouse for producing special effects. Spielberg stated that Tsuburaya's Godzilla was the \"most masterful of all the dinosaur movies, because it made you believe that it was really happening.\" His work has also been cited as the inspiration for the music video of Beastie Boys' song \"Intergalactic\", the series Power Rangers and the film Pacific Rim, among other projects.\n\nTributes\nTsuburaya had intended to work on Honda's Space Amoeba (1970), but he died shortly after filming began. While the film was completed in Tsuburaya's honor and was his last project to be involved in, Toho executives refused to grant him a dedication in its opening credits.\n\nA script for a project entitled Princess Kaguya was written by Tsuburaya shortly before he died in Izu. Motivated by his father's desire to work on another adaptation of the tale, Hajime Tsubruaya attempted to produce Princess Kaguya into a film for Tsuburaya Productions' 10th anniversary. In the preface of Hiroyasu Yamaura's script for the film, Hajime said he had taken \"great pains to incorporate the strengths of various folk tales and fairy tales into a work that children around the world would honestly enjoy\". Despite his tireless efforts, he died on the morning of February 9, 1973, before director Yoshiyuki Kuroda was scheduled to begin production that evening. Thus, production on the project was canceled. In 1987, producer Tomoyuki Tanaka turned Eiji Tsuburaya's lifelong ambition into a live-action movie titled Princess from the Moon, which featured effects directed by Tsuburaya's protégé Teruyoshi Nakano.\n\nIn 2001, two toy companies distributed figures of Tsuburaya in honor of the 100th anniversary of his birth. In celebration of the 114th anniversary of his birth, Google artist Jennifer Hom and her colleagues made an animated doodle of his work in special effects on July 7, 2015. The doodle allowed users to create a scene from one of Tsuburaya's key monster movies and television shows.\n\nOn January 11, 2019, after construction over a period of five years, the Eiji Tsuburaya Museum opened in his hometown of Sukagawa, a tribute to his life and work in film and television. During the museum's opening ceremony, Mayor Katsuya Hashimoto stated that the museum is \"an archival center that will disseminate Japanese special effects to the world.\" Later that year, filmmaker Minoru Kawasaki began filming Monster Seafood Wars, a kaiju film loosely based on his unmade film prior to production of Godzilla about a giant octopus that attacked Tokyo.\n\nIn commemoration of 120 years since his birth, the National Film Archive of Japan held a celebratory event in Sukagawa in cooperation with Tsuburaya Productions from August to November 2021. In September 2021, the first screening of Princess Kaguya since its original 1935 release was held at the event (However, it was in shortened form since the original print is still believed to be lost).\n\nOn July 10, 2022, a screening of Shin Ultraman (2022) was held at the City Cultural Center in Sukagawa as a tribute to Tsuburaya and his series Ultraman (1966-1967), on which the film was based. The screening was attended by an estimated 950 people, with Shin Ultraman director Shinji Higuchi and star Takumi Saitoh discussing the legacy of Tsuburaya's work afterward.\n\nFilmmaker and visual effects artist Takashi Yamazaki paid homage to Tsuburaya's work in his acclaimed 2023 film Godzilla Minus One.\n\nPortrayals\nMany actors have played Tsuburaya in television dramas and programs. For his portrayal in the 1989 television drama , an unidentified renowned Toho actor who had been starring in many of the company's box office hits since before Godzilla (1954) was initially cast as Tsuburaya. However, the famed actor declined the offer, believing he lacked resemblance in appearance to Tsuburaya and therefore was replaced by actor Kō Nishimura. In 1993, filmmaker Seijun Suzuki played Tsuburaya in the television drama . For , a 2022 television documentary on the two screenwriters behind Ultraman'', he was portrayed by .\n\nSelected filmography\n\nBecause he worked on roughly 250 films over his five-decade career, the following is only a selection of significant productions, and a more comprehensive list, including most of the media that featured his contributions, is covered in a separate article.\n\nFilms\n\nTelevision\n\nAwards and honors \nYearAwardCategoryNominated workResult1940Special Technology AwardThe Burning Sky rowspan=\"11\" 1942Technical Research AwardThe War at Sea from Hawaiito Malaya19548th Japan Technical AwardsSpecial SkillGodzilla195711th Japan Technical AwardsThe Mysterians195913th Japan Technical AwardsThe Three Treasures 4th  Special Award of Merit  196317th Japan Technical AwardsSpecial SkillThe Lost World of Sinbad196519th Japan Technical Awards196620th Japan Technical AwardsInvasion of Astro-Monster1970 4th Class Medal of the Order ofthe Sacred Treasure rowspan=\"2\" Japanese Society of CinematographersHonorary Chairman Award",

    "clean_text": "Sindhu-Sauvīra (Sanskrit: ; Pāli: ) was an ancient Indo-Aryan kingdom of the lower Indus Valley in western South Asia (present-day Sindh) whose existence is attested during the Iron Age. The inhabitants of Sindhu were called the Saindhavas, and the inhabitants of Sauvīra were called Sauvīrakas.\n\nLocation\n\nThe territory of Sindhu-Sauvīra covered the lower Indus Valley, with its southern border being the Indian Ocean and its northern border being the Pañjāb around Multān.\n\nSindhu was the name of the inland area between the Indus River and the Sulaiman Mountains, while Sauvīra was the name for the coastal part of the kingdom as well as the inland area to the east of the Indus river as far north as the area of modern-day Multan.\n\nThe capital of Sindhu-Sauvīra was named Roruka and Vītabhaya or Vītībhaya, and corresponds to the mediaeval Arohṛ and the modern-day Rohṛī. Roruka is mentioned in the Buddhist literature as a major trading center.Derryl N. MacLean (1989), Religion and Society in Arab Sind, p.63\n\nHistory\nSindhu-Sauvira finds mention in Late Vedic,Michael Witzel (1987), \"On the localisation of Vedic texts and schools (Materials on Vedic Śākhās, 7)\" in G. Pollet (ed.), India and the Ancient world. History, Trade and Culture before A.D. 650 early Buddhist and early Jain literature.\n\nKingdom\nDuring the 6th to 5th centuries BCE, the Sindhu-Sauvīra was ruled by a powerful king named Udāyana or Udrāyaṇa or Rudrāyaṇa by various sources. Udāyana was married to the princess Prabhāvatī, who was the daughter of Ceṭaka, the consul of the powerful Vajjika League in north-east South Asia, and was herself thus the cousin of the 24th Jain Tīrthaṅkara Mahāvīra, himself the son of Chetaka's sister Trisalā. Ceṭaka had become an adept of the teachings of his nephew Mahāvīra and adopted Jainism, thus making the Licchavika and Vajjika capital of Vesālī a bastion of Jainism, and the marriages of his daughters to various leaders, in turn, contributed to the spreading of Jainism across northern South Asia.\n\nTherefore, according to Jain sources, Udāyana converted to Jainism after hearing Mahāvīra preach at Vītabhya, and he abdicated his throne and became a Jain monk after installing his nephew by his sister, Keśīkumāra, as king of Sindhu-Sauvira, instead of his own son, Abhijitkumāra, who found asylum at the court of Kūṇika, the governor of the Āṅgeya city of Campā for the count of the king of Magadha. However, Buddhist sources instead claim that Udrāyaṇa embraced Buddhism and was ordained by the Buddha.\n\nPersian conquest\n\nIn 518 BCE, Sindhu-Sauvīra was conquered by the Persian Achaemenid Empire's  (\"King of Kings\"), Darius I, after which it was organised into the satrapy (province) of .\n\nLater history\nRoruka was probably the capital of the king Mousikanos, who was encountered by Alexander the Great while sailing down the Indus in 326 BCE.\n\nThe Sauvīra people or country were mentioned in the Junâgaḍh inscription of Rudradáman (150 CE).\n\nBuddhist sites in Sindh are numerous, including a stupa at Brahmanabad (Mansura); Sirah-ji-takri near Rohri, Sukkur; Kahu-Jo-Daro at Mirpur Khas, Nawabshah; Sudheran-Jo-Thul near Hyderabad; Thul Mir Rukan stupa; Thul Hairo Khan Stupa; Bhaleel-Shah-Thul square stupas (5th–7th century A.D) at Dadu, and Kot-Bambhan-Thul buddhist tower near Tando Muhammad Khan. In the 12th century king Kumarapala excavated an ancient Jivantasvami Mahavira image from the ruins of Vītabhaya-pattana, and brought it to be installed at a Jain temple in his capital city Patan.",

    "title": "White Building (Phnom Penh)",
    "clean_text": "thumb|The White Building in 2014\nThe White Building, originally known as the Municipal Apartments, was a large and prominent apartment building in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, one of the buildings in the Bassac development. The White Building was on Samdach Sothearos Boulevard near the Bassac River, a large urban extension project built on reclaimed land in the early 1960s. After being abandoned during the Khmer Rouge era, it became a squat. After many years of neglect, it was declared unsafe by authorities, its residents evicted and it was demolished in 2017.\n\nHistory \nThe UN consultants Gérald Hanning and Vladimir Bodiansky introduced the concept of the building, a  architectural composition, directly inspired by previous AT.BAT designs built in Morocco.  Lu Ban Hap, then Chief Architect of the Municipality of Phnom Penh, was responsible for the site supervision. The White Building was designed to house moderate-income tenants, and was adopted by many artists who found the innovative design appealing. With the nearby Grey Building, designed by Vann Molyvann, it was initially built for athletes in the 1964 GANEFO (Games of the non-aligned forces) international sports event. After years of neglect and deterioration since the fall of the Khmer Rouge, the White Building was demolished in 2017.\n\nThe building was composed of six blocks of concrete construction, three or four stories tall, connected by open bridge structures, along a double-loaded spine. It included stores and doctors' offices as well as 468 apartments.\n\nTenants fled during the Cambodian genocide in the 1970s. After the defeat of the Khmer Rouge in 1979 the White Building was reoccupied by former tenants and squatters. It gradually declined and became known for poverty, drug use and prostitution. Its population in 2015 was about 2500.\n\nAccording to municipal authorities, the building was structurally deteriorating and unsafe. Tenants used the high-ceilinged rooms to add lofts, and balconies were enclosed, obscuring the once-white building's design and also adding weight to the structure. Cracking appeared in 2015 after construction on an adjoining lot.  Several proposals have been made to tear it down for redevelopment. Eviction orders were issued in July 2015. However, the building's status as an iconic New Khmer building stimulated preservation efforts.\n\nDemolition \nIn July 2017, the almost 500 families still living in the White Building were moving out; the building was to be replaced by a 21-storey mixed-use development. In 2018 it was revealed that the site was not to be a Japanese-backed mixed-use residential and retail tower as cited prior to the demolition of the building, but instead a $3.5bn casino was intended for the site by owners NagaCorp, their third casino in Phnom Penh.",

Its surface appears smooth and glossy, displaying a pale straw-colored hue that becomes greenish at the base. The apex presents a rosy coloration and is finely dotted with reddish markings. It consists of 6.5-7 slightly convex whorls, with the body whorl being ventrose and obtusely angled, and exhibiting fine ribbing on its back. The spire is a little shorter than the aperture, and the suture shows an orange color. The columella is vertical or slightly receding. The aperture is oblong, angled at the base, and milky white inside. The peristome is somewhat expanded and is tinged purplish on the inside and violet on the outside near the suture. Its margins are joined by a thin, purple callus, and the columellar margin is dilated.\n\nDistribution \nThe type locality is Cambodia, and the species is also present in Sekong Province and Champasak Province in Laos.",

Archived 6 August 2016. and after Michel Martelly resigned the presidency and Prime Minister Evans Paul assumed office as acting president on 7 February 2016. The members of the National Assembly voted for the interim President on 13 February 2016 in the first round and on 14 February in the second round. \n\nJocelerme Privert of Inite was elected interim President to serve until the conclusion of the 2016–17 elections. Under a multi-party agreement, Privert was supposed to oversee these elections and hand power to an elected successor within 120 days, by 14 June 2016, though electoral deadlines were missed. Following allegations of fraud in the 2015 elections, Privert created a month-long verification commission to restore legitimacy to the electoral process. In May 2016, the commission audited about 13,000 ballots and determined that the elections had been dishonest and recommended a complete rerun of the election. The rerun election took place on 20 November 2016. The second round had been scheduled for 29 January 2017, but did not take place as Jovenel Moïse was a clear winner in the first round. In the end, Privert continued in office as interim President until 7 February 2017.\n\nResults\nCandidateFirst roundSecond roundSenatevotesChambervotesTotalvotesSenatevotesChambervotesTotalvotesJocelerme Privert134558136477Edgard Leblanc Fils10465692433Déjean Bélizaire000022Invalid/blank votes011022Total23921152292114Source: Haiti Libre",

    "clean_text": "Abu Abdullah Muhammad ibn Yusuf ibn Nasr (; 22 January 1273), also known as Ibn al-Ahmar (, ) and by his honorific al-Ghalib billah (, ), was the first ruler of the Emirate of Granada, the last independent Muslim state on the Iberian Peninsula, and the founder of its ruling Nasrid dynasty. He lived during a time when Iberia's Christian kingdoms—especially Portugal, Castile and Aragon—were expanding at the expense of the Islamic territory in Iberia, called Al-Andalus. Muhammad ibn Yusuf took power in his native Arjona in 1232 when he rebelled against the de facto leader of Al-Andalus, Ibn Hud.  During this rebellion, he was able to take control of Córdoba and Seville briefly, before he lost both cities to Ibn Hud. Forced to acknowledge Ibn Hud's suzerainty, Muhammad was able to retain Arjona and Jaén. In 1236, he betrayed Ibn Hud by helping Ferdinand III of Castile take Córdoba. In the years that followed, Muhammad was able to gain control over southern cities, including Granada (1237), Almería (1238), and Málaga (1239). In 1244, he lost Arjona to Castile. Two years later, in 1246, he agreed to surrender Jaén and accept Ferdinand's overlordship in exchange for a 20-year truce.\n\nIn the 18 years that followed, Muhammad consolidated his domain by maintaining relatively peaceful relations with the Crown of Castile; in 1248; he even helped the Christian kingdom take Seville from the Muslims. But in 1264, he turned against Castile and assisted in the unsuccessful rebellion of Castile's newly conquered Muslim subjects. In 1266 his allies in Málaga, the Banu Ashqilula, rebelled against the emirate. When these former allies sought assistance from Alfonso X of Castile, Muhammad was able to convince the leader of the Castilian troops, Nuño González de Lara, to turn against Alfonso. By 1272 Nuño González was actively fighting Castile. The emirate's conflict with Castile and the Banu Ashqilula was still unresolved in 1273 when Muhammad died after falling off his horse. He was succeeded by his son, Muhammad II.\n\nThe Emirate of Granada, which Muhammad founded, and the Nasrid royal house, lasted for two more centuries until it was annexed by Castile in 1492. His other legacy was the construction of the Alhambra, his residence in Granada. His successors would continue to build the palace and fortress complex and reside there, and it has lasted to the present day as the architectural legacy of the emirate.\n\nOrigin and early life \nthumb|alt=Map of the Emirate of Granada and the surrounding regions|A map of Southern Spain around Muhammad's time, including the Emirate of Granada which he was to found. Green/pale yellow: Granada.|upright=1.5\n\nMuhammad ibn Yusuf was born in 1195 in the town of Arjona, then a small frontier Muslim town south of the Guadalquivir, now in Spain's province of Jaén. He came from a humble background, and, in the words of the Castilian First General Chronicle, initially he had \"no other occupation than following the oxen and the plough\".  His clan was known as the Banu Nasr or the Banu al-Ahmar. According to later Granadan historian and vizier Ibn al-Khatib, the clan was descended from a prominent companion of the Islamic prophet Muhammad known as Sa'd ibn Ubadah of the Banu Khazraj tribe; Sa'd's descendants migrated to Spain and settled in Arjona as farmers. During his early life he became known for his leadership activity on the frontiers and for his ascetic image, which he maintained even after becoming  a ruler.\n\nMuhammad was also known as Ibn al-Ahmar, or by his kunya Abu Abdullah.\n\nFamily \nMuhammad I was married to a paternal first cousin (a bint 'amm marriage), Aisha bint Muhammad, likely in 1230 or before, when he was still in Arjona. Their first son was Faraj (1230 or 1231–1256), whose early death was recorded to cause Muhammad considerable sadness. Their other children included Yusuf (birth unknown), who also died during Muhammad I's lifetime; Muhammad (the future Muhammad II, 1235 or 1236–1302) and two daughters Mu'mina and Shams. He also had a brother, Ismail (d. 1257), whom he appointed as governor of Malaga, and who was the male-line ancestor of a line of future sultans of Granada starting from Ismail I.\n\nBackground \n\nthumb|alt=Map of the Iberian peninsula in 1210|Map of the Iberian peninsula in 1210, before the break up of the Almohad caliphate and the subsequent loss of Muslim territories to the Christian kingdoms\n\nThe early thirteenth century was a period of great loss for the Muslims of the Iberian Peninsula. The Almohad caliphate, which had dominated Al-Andalus or the Muslim Iberia, was split by a dynastic struggle after Caliph Yusuf II died in 1224 without an heir. Al-Andalus broke up into multiple small kingdoms or taifas. One of the taifa leaders was Muhammad ibn Yusuf ibn Hud (d. 1238), who revolted against the Almohads and nominally proclaimed the authority of the Abbasid caliphate but in practice ruled independently from Murcia. His growing strength made him the de facto leader of Al-Andalus, and briefly Muhammad's overlord. Despite his popularity and his success in Al-Andalus, Ibn Hud had suffered defeats against the Christians, including at Alanje in 1230 and at Jerez in 1231, followed by the loss of Badajoz and Extremadura.\n\nIn the north of the peninsula there were several Christian kingdoms: Castile, León (in a union with Castile since 1231), Portugal, Navarre, and a union of kingdoms known as the Crown of Aragon. They had been expanding south—taking formerly Muslim-ruled territories—in a process called the Reconquista or \"the reconquest\". All of the kingdoms had sizable Muslim minorities. By the mid-thirteenth century, Castile was the largest kingdom of the peninsula. Its king, Ferdinand III () took advantage of the addition of León to his realm and of the Muslims' disunity to launch a southward expansion into Muslim territories, eventually conquering Córdoba (1236) and Seville (1248).\n\nRise to power \nThe defeats suffered by Ibn Hud eroded his credibility; rebellions broke out in parts of his domain, including Muhammad's small town of Arjona. On 16 July 1232, a mosque assembly in Arjona declared the town's independence. This proclamation took place on 26 Ramadan 629 in the Islamic calendar, after the final Friday prayer of the holy month. The assembly elected Muhammad, who was known for his piety and his martial reputation in previous conflicts against the Christians, as the town's leader. Muhammad also had the support of his clan, the Banu Nasr, and an allied Arjonan clan known as the Banu Ashqilula.\n\nIn the same year, Muhammad took Jaén—an important city close to Arjona. With help from Ibn Hud's rivals, the Banu al-Mawl, Muhammad briefly seized control of the former disputed seat of Córdoba. He also took Seville in 1234 with help from the Banu al-Bajji family, but he was only able to hold it for one month. Both Córdoba and Seville, dissatisfied with Muhammad's ruling style, returned to Ibn Hud's rule shortly after Muhammad's takeover. After these failures, Muhammad once again declared his allegiance to Ibn Hud and kept his rule over a small region containing Arjona, Jaén, Porcuna, Guadix, and Baeza.\n\nMuhammad turned against Ibn Hud again in 1236. He allied himself with Ferdinand and helped the Castilians take Córdoba and end centuries of Muslim rule in the city. In the following years, Muhammad took control of important cities in the south. In May 1237 (Ramadan 634 AH), by invitation of the city's notables, he took Granada, which he then made his capital. He also took Almería in 1238 and Málaga in 1239. He did not take these southern cities by force, but through political maneuvering and the consent of the inhabitants.\n\nRuler of Granada \n Settling in Granada \nthumb|alt=Modern-day photo of the Alhambra|Upon entering Granada, Muhammad started the construction of the Alhambra (pictured).\n\nMuhammad entered Granada in May 1238 (Ramadan 635). According to Ibn al-Khatib, he entered the city dressed like a sufi, in a plain wool cap, coarse clothes and sandals. He took up residence in the alcazaba (castle) built by the Zirids of Granada in the 11th century. He then inspected an area known as al-Hamra, where there was a small fortress, and laid the foundations there for his future residence and fortress. Soon work began on defensive structures, an irrigation dam, and a dike. The construction would last into the reigns of his successors, and the complex would be known as the Alhambra and would become the residence of all Nasrid rulers up to the surrender of Granada in 1492. He pressured his tax collectors to collect the necessary funds for the construction, going as far as executing Almería's tax-gatherer Abu Muhammad ibn Arus to enforce his demands. He also used money sent by the Hafsid ruler of Tunis—intended for defense against the Christians—to extend the city's mosque.\n\n Initial conflict with Castile \nthumb|alt=An 1883 painting showing Muhammad kissing the hand of Ferdinand III of Castile, while surrendering Jaén and agreeing to be his vassal.|Muhammad kissing the hand of Ferdinand III of Castile, while surrendering Jaén and agreeing to be his vassal (1883 painting by Pedro González Bolívar)\n\nBy the end of the 1230s, Muhammad had become the most powerful Muslim ruler in Iberia. He controlled the major cities of the south, including Granada, Almería, Málaga and Jaén. In the early 1240s, Muhammad came into conflict with his former allies, the Castilians, who were invading Muslim territories. Contemporary sources disagree about the cause of this hostility: the Christian First General Chronicle blamed it on Muslim raiding, while Muslim historian Ibn Khaldun blamed it on Christian invasions of Muslim territories. In 1242, Muslim forces successfully raided Andújar and Martos near Jaén. In 1244, Castile besieged and captured Muhammad's hometown of Arjona.\n\nIn 1245, Ferdinand III of Castile besieged the heavily fortified Jaén. Ferdinand did not want to risk assaulting the city, so his tactic was to cut it off from the rest of the Muslim territory and starve it into submission. Muhammad tried to send supplies to this important city, but these efforts were thwarted by the besiegers. Due to Muhammad's difficulty in defending and relieving Jaén, he agreed to terms with Ferdinand. In exchange for peace, Muhammad surrendered the city and agreed to pay Ferdinand an annual tribute of 150,000 maravedíes—an amount that became Ferdinand's most important source of income. This agreement was made in March 1246, seven months into the siege of Jaén. As part of the agreement he was required to kiss Ferdinand's hand to signify his vassalage, and promised him \"counsel and aid\". Castilian sources tended to emphasize this event as an act of feudal submission and considered Muhammad and his successors as vassals of Castile in the feudal sense. On the other hand, Muslim sources avoided mentions of any vassal-lord relation and tended to frame the relationship as between equals with certain obligations. After the agreement, the Castilians entered the city and expelled its Muslim inhabitants.\n\n Peace \nThe peace agreement with Castile largely held for almost twenty years. In 1248, Muhammad demonstrated his commitment to Ferdinand by sending a contingent to help the Castilian conquest of the Muslim-held Seville.  In 1252, Ferdinand died and was succeeded by Alfonso X. In 1254, Muhammad attended a Cortes, or an assembly of Alfonso's vassals, at the royal palace in Toledo, where he renewed his promise of loyalty and tributes, as well as paying homage to Alfonso's newborn daughter Berengaria. During his reign, Alfonso was more interested in other enterprises—including a series of unsuccessful campaigns in Muslim North Africa—rather than renewing the conflict with Granada. Muhammad met with Alfonso at the latter's court in Seville every year, and paid his annual tributes. Muhammad used the ensuing peace to consolidate his new emirate. Though small in size, the Emirate of Granada was relatively wealthy and densely populated. Its economy was focused on agriculture, especially silk and dried fruit; it traded with Italy and northern Europe. Islamic literature, art and architecture continued to flourish. The mountains and desert that separate the kingdom from Castile provided natural defenses, but its western ports and the northwestern route to Granada were less defensible.\n\nDuring his rule, Muhammad placed loyal men in castles and cities. His brother Isma'il was governor of Málaga until 1257. Following Isma'il's death in 1257, Muhammad appointed his nephew, Abu Muhammad ibn Ashqilula, as governor of Málaga.\n\n Rift with Castile \nPeace between Granada and Castile lasted until the early 1260s, when various actions by Castile alarmed Muhammad. As part of his crusade against Muslim North Africa, Alfonso built up his military presence in Cadiz and El Puerto de Santa María close to Granadan territory. Castile conquered the Muslim-held Jerez de la Frontera in 1261 near the Granadan border and installed a garrison there. In 1262, Castile conquered the Kingdom of Niebla, another Muslim enclave in Spain. In May 1262, during a meeting in Jaén, Alfonso requested that Muhammad hand the port cities of Tarifa and Algeciras to him. The demand for these strategically important ports was very worrying to Muhammad, and although he verbally agreed he kept delaying the transfer. Further, in 1263 Castile expelled the Muslim inhabitants of Écija and resettled the town with Christians.\n\nIn light of these actions, Muhammad was worried that he would become Alfonso's next target. He began talks with Abu Yusuf Yaqub, the Marinid Sultan in Morocco, who then sent troops to Granada, numbering between 300 and 3,000 according to different sources. In 1264, Muhammad and 500 knights traveled to the Castilian court at Seville to discuss an extension of the 1246 truce. Alfonso invited them to lodge at the former Abbadid palace next to the city's mosque. During the night, the Castilians locked and barricaded the area. Muhammad perceived this as a trap, ordered his men to break out and returned to Granada. Alfonso argued that the barricade was to protect the entourage from Christian thieves, but Muhammad was angered, and ordered troops in his border towns to prepare for war. He declared himself vassal of Muhammad I al-Mustansir, the Hafsid sultan of Tunis.\n\n Revolt of the Mudéjars \n\nthumb|alt=A drawing showing the siege of a castle|A Christian-held castle besieged by Muslim troops during the Mudéjar revolt of 1264–1266\n\nThe peace was broken in either late April or early May 1264. Muhammad attacked Castile, and at the same time Muslims in the territories recently conquered by Castile (\"Mudéjars\") rebelled; partially over Alfonso's forced relocation policy and partially at Muhammad's instigation. Initially, Murcia, Jerez, Utrera, Lebrija, Arcos and Medina Sidonia were taken into Muslim control, but counterattacks by James I of Aragon and Alfonso retook these territories, and Alfonso invaded Granada's territory in 1265. Muhammad soon sued for peace, and the resulting settlement was devastating for the rebels: the Muslims of Andalusia suffered mass expulsions, replaced by Christians.\n\nFor Granada, the defeat had mixed consequences. On the one hand, it was soundly defeated, and according to the peace treaty signed at Alcalá de Benzaide had to pay an annual tribute of 250,000 maravedíes to Castile—much larger than what had been paid before the rebellion. On the other hand, the treaty ensured its survival, and it emerged as the sole independent Muslim state in the peninsula. Muslims who were expelled by Castile immigrated to Granada, bolstering the emirate's population.\n\n Conflict with the Banu Ashqilula \nThe Banu Ashqilula were a clan and—like the Nasrids—were also from Arjona. They had been the Nasrids' most important allies during their rise to power. They supported Muhammad's appointment as leader of Arjona in 1232 and helped with the acquisition of cities like Seville and Granada. Both families intermarried, and Muhammad appointed members of the Banu Ashqilula as governors in his territories. The Banu Ashqilula's center of power was in Málaga, where Muhammad's nephew Abu Muhammad ibn Ashqilula was governor. Their military strength was the backbone of Granada's power.\n\nBy 1266, while Granada was still fighting Castile in the Mudéjar revolt, the Banu Ashqilula started a rebellion against Muhammad I. Sources are scarce regarding the beginning of the rebellion and historians disagree about the cause of the rift between the two families. Professor of Hispano-Islamic history Rachel Arié suggested that contributing factors may have been the 1257 declaration of Muhammad's sons—Muhammad and Yusuf—as heirs and his 1266 decision to marry one of his granddaughter Fatima to a Nasrid cousin instead of one of the Banu Ashqilula. According to Arié, these decisions alarmed the Banu Ashqilula because Muhammad had previously promised to share power with them and these decisions excluded them from the Nasrid dynasty's inner circle. In contrast, another historian of Islamic Spain, María Jesús Rubiera Mata rejected these explanations; she argued that the Banu Ashqilula were worried about Muhammad's decision to invite North African forces during the 1264 Revolt of the Mudéjars because the new military power threatened the Banu Ashqilula's position as the strongest military power in the Emirate.\n\nMuhammad besieged Málaga but failed to overpower the Banu Ashqilula military strength. The Banu Ashqilula sought assistance from Alfonso X of Castile, who was happy to support the rebellion to undermine Muhammad's authority. Alfonso sent 1,000 soldiers under Nuño González de Lara and Muhammad was forced to break off the siege of Málaga. The danger of fighting at multiple fronts contributed to Muhammad's decision to finally seek peace with Alfonso. In the resulting agreement of Alcalá de Benzaide, Muhammad renounced his claims over Jerez and Murcia—territories not under his control—and promised to pay an annual tribute of 250,000 maravedies. In exchange, Alfonso abandoned his alliance with the Banu Ashqilula and acknowledged Muhammad's authority over them.\n\nAlfonso was reluctant to enforce the last point and did not move against the Banu Ashqilula. Muhammad countered by convincing Nuño González, the commander of the Castilian forces sent to support the Banu Ashqilula, to rebel against Alfonso. Nuño González, who had grievances against his king, agreed; in 1272 he and his Castilian noble allies began operations against Castile from Granada. Muhammad had successfully deprived Castile of Nuño González's forces and gained allies in his conflict against the Banu Ashqilula. The Banu Ashqilula agreed to negotiate under the mediation of Al-Tahurti from Morocco.\n\nBefore these efforts bore fruit, Muhammad suffered fatal injuries after falling from a horse on 22 January 1273 (29 Jumada al-Thani 671 AH), near the city of Granada during a minor military expedition. He was buried in a cemetery on the Sabika Hill, east of the Alhambra. An epitaph was inscribed on his headstone and was recorded by Ibn al-Khatib and other historical sources. He was succeeded by his son Muhammad II as he had planned. Later that year, Muhammad II and Alfonso negotiated a truce—albeit short-lived—between Granada and Castile as well as the Banu Ashqilula.\n\nSuccession \nBy the time of his death in 1273, Muhammad had already secured the succession for his son, also named Muhammad, known by the epithet al-Faqih (the canon-lawyer). On his deathbed, Muhammad I advised his heir to seek protection from the Marinid dynasty against the Christian kingdoms. The son, now Muhammad II, was already 38 years old and experienced in the matters of state and war. He was able to continue Muhammad I's policies and would rule until his death in 1302.\n\nLegacy \nthumb|alt=A bust statue of Muhammad I in Islamic garb|A bust statue of Muhammad I in his birthplace, Arjona\n\nMuhammad's main legacy was the founding of the Emirate of Granada under the rule of the Nasrid dynasty, which on his death was the only independent Muslim state remaining in the Iberian peninsula, and would last for little over two centuries before its fall in 1492. The emirate spanned  between Tarifa in the west and eastern frontiers beyond Almería, and was around  wide from the sea to its northern frontiers.\n\nDuring his lifetime, the Muslims of al-Andalus suffered severe setbacks, including the loss of the Guadalquivir valley, which included the major cities of Córdoba and Seville as well as Muhammad's hometown of Arjona. According to professor of Spanish history L. P. Harvey, he \"managed to snatch from disaster ... a relatively secure refuge for Islam in the peninsula\". His rule was characterized both by his \"unheroic\" part in the fall of Muslim cities like Seville and Jaén, as well his vigilance and political astuteness which ensured the survival of Granada. He was willing to enter into compromises, including accepting vassalage to Castile, as well as to switch alliances between Christians and Muslims, to preserve the emirate's independence. The Encyclopaedia of Islam comments that while his rule did not have any \"spectacular victories\", he did create a stable regime in Granada and start the construction of the Alhambra, a \"lasting memorial to the Nasrids\". The Alhambra is today a UNESCO World Heritage Site.UNESCO World Heritage List, 314-001\n\nHis religious views appeared to transform during his career. In the beginning, he displayed an outward image of an ascetic religious frontiersman, like a typical Islamic mystic. He maintained this outlook during his early rule in Granada, but as his rule stabilized, he began to embrace the mainstream Sunni orthodoxy and enforced the doctrines of the Maliki fuqaha. This transformation and his commitment to mainstream Islam brought Granada into line with the rest of the Islamic world, and were continued by his successors.",

Each of these musicians came to the group with years of experience in not only Hawaiian music, but many other kinds, such as American swing, jazz and Latin rhythms.\n\nGabby Pahinui (slack-key guitar) had been playing clubs in Hawaii for over 20 years and had a loyal following of devoted fans. Gabby played with many of the great bands and musicians of his time and the all-weekend jam sessions at his home were legendary.All About Jazz \n\nEddie Kamae had long been one of Hawaii's top ukulele players. Known for his technical wizardry and unique blend of Spanish rhythm, he toured the mainland and was a featured soloist in a show that brought the sound of the ukulele to the status of a full-fledged solo instrument.\n\nJoe Marshall (upright bass) had been playing music since high school. He had played with the best Hawaiian musicians, and was a singer.\n \nDavid 'Feet' Rogers, steel guitarist, was just 16 when he joined the band. Kamae, Pahinui and Marshall drove across the island to hear this young man play. His father was also an accomplished steel guitar player.\n\nA few years after the group was formed they went their own separate ways until the middle to late 1960s when they reformed with the members Kamae, Marshall, Rogers, Atta Isaacs and Bobby Larson.\n\nBy the end of the 1960s the group included Kamae, Marshall, Rogers, Sonny Chillingworth and Zulu, who acted on Hawaii Five-O.\nIn 1970, the group reassembled once more, this time to make another album. To the original four musicians was added ukulele master Moe Keale.\n\nThe group played a pivotal role in the second Hawaiian Renaissance when Kamae set out to revitalize traditional Hawaiian music by going to the rural countryside and learning from the old-timers both the music and meanings. The rural folks shared with him old family songs and their meanings. Burl Burlingame of the Honolulu Star-Bulletin describes this as:\n\n\"Although the group was a hit from the first, one of the first stumbling blocks was that none of the members spoke Hawaiian. Kamae sought the advice of Mary Kawena Pukui, legendary Bishop Museum master of the Hawaiian language, and this started him on his life's parallel journey along with music; a consuming scholarship of all things Hawaiian, and more importantly, a student of the process by which such knowledge is transmitted between generations – or not transmitted.\"\n\nIn 1973, Kamae brought the group back together, minus Pahinui, and added a young Hawaiian singer-songwriter named Dennis Kamakahi (Grammy Award-winning recording artist and music composer). This was the fifth Sons of Hawaii incarnation.\n\nOn November 16, 1985, Eddie Kamae and the Sons of Hawaii were featured on A Prairie Home Companion, along with the Kahelelani Serenaders, Taj Mahal with Carlos Andrade and his band, and the Kamehameha High School Glee Club, as well as Chet Atkins and Johnny Gimble plus the show regulars. This is one of their few live recordings. Songs played by The Sons of Hawaii include \"Hanakeoki\", \"E Hihiwai\" and the classic \"Ulili E (Sandpiper)\".\n\nIn 1989, the seventh and final incarnation of the Sons of Hawaii consisted of Kamae, Marshall, George Kuo, Braddah Smitty, Dennis Kamakahi; sometimes Gary Haleamau and steel player Paul Kim would join them. When Joe Marshall died, Ocean Kaowili became the bass player. This was the last Sons of Hawaii, as Eddie Kamae retired in 1992.",

The temple belongs to the Ji sect and its full name is .\n\nHistory\nFounded in the Heian period as the Tendai sect temple of Anpuku-ji (安福寺), the temple was originally located in Nakasuura, Iwami. In 1313, the temple was destroyed by a tsunami and in 1319, Donkai, the 4th generation successor to the founder of the Ji sect, Ippen, revived the temple as a dōjō of the sect. In 1374, Masuda Kanemi, the 11th chieftain of the Masuda clan and castellan of Nanao Castle, moved the temple to its current location and renamed it \"Manpuku-ji\", making it a bodaiji of his clan.  The current Main Hall of the temple dates from this 1374 reconstruction, and was designated an National Important Cultural Property in 1904.\n\nDuring the Bunmei era (1469-1487), the noted Zen prelate Sesshū Tōyō came to Masuda to study Zen and to create gardens with spiritual significance. The garden at Manpuku-ji is one survivor of several gardens he created in the area during that time . In 1866, during the Second Chōshū expedition, the Battle of Sekishuguchi was fought in Masuda.  Manpuku-ji became a stronghold of the pro-shogunate forces of Hamada Domain.  The main gate was destroyed, and a number of bullet holes remain in the pillars of its Main Hall.\n\nThe gardens of the temple were designated a National Historic Site and a National Place of Scenic Beauty in 1928.\n\nManpuku-ji is located approximately three kilometers east of Masuda Station JR West San'in Main Line.",

He was one of the founders of the Heidelberg Burschenschaft, and participated in the famous Wartburg festival. He was afterward a member of the provisional German parliament () of 1848.\nCarové was a pupil of Hegel's between 1816 and 1818 and was chosen by Hegel as the first interpreter of his thought. They were in friendly terms for all their life. Due to his publication of a booklet on the Sand Affair in 1819, he was investigated by the police and arrested, thus excluded from the post in Berlin University. He was harassed and put under surveillance by Prince Sayn-Wittgenstein and his reactionary circles in the Prussian court. Carové's career was thus destroyed despite Hegel's best efforts to help him.\n\nIn 2022 over 4000 pages of his notes and transcriptions of Hegel's lectures were found by Klaus Vieweg in the library of Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Munich and Freising. The manuscripts were believed to be a gift sent by Carové to Karl Joseph Hieronymus Windischmann, a friend of Hegel's, as a gift.\n\nWorks\n\nHis most elaborate works are attacks on the Roman Catholic religion, and include:\n Ueber die alleinseligmachende Kirche (2 vols., Frankfurt, 1826)\n Was heisst römisch-katholische Kirche? (2d ed., Altenburg, 1847)\n Die Buchdruckerkunst in ihrer weltgeschichtlichen Bedeutung (Siegen, 1843)\n Ueber das sogenannte germanische und sogenannte christliche Staatsprincip (1843)",

The hospital provides health care to people whose lives have been traumatized by war, and trains nurses, midwives, and other health workers. In addition to services and facilities relating specifically to maternal and infant health care, the hospital has diagnostic laboratory facilities and an emergency blood bank, and offers diagnosis and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases.\n\nIt works in collaboration with the Ministry of Health, UNICEF, and WHO to train a new generation of nurses and midwives to provide Reproductive Health care throughout the Somaliland region.\n\nAnother aspect of the hospital's mission is to combat the practice of female circumcision, which is endemic to the region. Mothers of newborn girls are counseled on the dangers of having their child circumcised; the tradition is strongly ingrained in the culture.Edna Adan discusses Female Genital Mutilation in Somaliland  at Ohio University, 2008\n\nHistory\nthumb|left|Edna Adan Ismail with a class of nursing school graduates\nFollowing the Somali Civil War, the entire health infrastructure of Somaliland was effectively destroyed and there were few, if any, trained medical personnel remaining in the region.Working together to rebuild health care in post-conflict Somaliland report by the medical journal The Lancet, Sept. 23, 2006 The rate of maternal and infant mortality was among the highest in the world. Edna Adan donated her U.N. pension and other personal assets to build the hospital so that she might help to address the grave health crisis.\n\nNeeding, first of all, a place to build her hospital, she asked the government for land near the city center. They responded by offering her 9600 square meters which previously had served as a garbage dump.\n\nThe construction of the hospital was started on January 1, 1998 and as it progressed, private individuals, business people in Somaliland and elsewhere, as well as international organizations, also made valuable contributions enabling the hospital to become functional on the March 9, 2002.\n\nDirect Relief describes the hospital as Somaliland's premier referral center for obstetric emergencies.Edna Adan Maternity and Teaching Hospital profile at Direct Relief International. The hospital trains nurses and midwives under the close supervision of Mrs. Ismail, herself a trained nurse, whose residence is inside of the hospital.\n\nThe hospital is supported by two charities: The Edna Adan Foundation first became a registered charity in 2016 in the UK.

    "title": "The Noon Witch",
    "clean_text": "The Noon Witch (or The Noonday Witch; ), Op. 108, B. 196, is a symphonic poem written in 1896 by Antonín Dvořák which was inspired by the Karel Jaromír Erben poem Polednice from the collection Kytice.  Polednice is based on the noon demon \"Lady Midday\" of Slavic mythology. It is one of a set of late orchestral works inspired by national themes which were written after his return to his native Bohemia from the United States.\n\nSynopsis \nA mother warns her son that if he does not behave she will summon the Noon Witch to take him away. He does not behave, and the witch arrives at the stroke of noon. The witch, described as a horrible creature, demands the child. The mother, terrified that the witch has actually come, grabs her son, and the witch begins chasing them. Finally the mother faints, grasping her child. Later that day, the father arrives home, and finds his wife passed out with the dead body of their son in her arms. The mother had accidentally smothered their son while protecting him from the witch. The story ends with the father's lament over the terrible event.\n\nComposition \nThe piece is scored for piccolo, two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets in A, bass clarinet in A, two bassoons, four horns (in F and E), two trumpets in C, three trombones, tuba, timpani, crash cymbals, bass drum, triangle, tubular bells (in C & A), and strings.\n\nDvořák's music follows the story closely and the orchestration is often used to illustrate characters and events: the oboe and bass clarinet are used to depict the misbehaving child and the witch respectively, whilst twelve strokes of a bell signal the coming of noon.  During the witch's chase, the music alternates between two different time signatures as a further dramatic device.\n\nA semi-public performance was given at the Prague Conservatory on 3 June 1896 under Antonín Bennewitz.  Its first full public première was on 21 November 1896, in London, under the baton of Henry Wood. The piece lasts about 13 minutes.",

    "clean_text": "Joan Vaux, Lady Guildford (c. 1463 – 4 September 1538),Some sources cite her forename as \"Jane\" also known as Mother Guildford, was an English courtier who was the Lady Governess to the Princesses Margaret Tudor and Mary Tudor.Debra Barrett-Graves, 'Joan Vaux Guildford Poyntz', Carole Levin, Anna Riehl Bertolet, Jo Eldridge Carney, A Biographical Encyclopedia of Early Modern Englishwomen (Routledge, 2017), p. 471.  She accompanied Mary Tudor to France when she married King Louis XII in 1514.Kathy Lynn Emerson, A Who's Who of Tudor Women, retrieved on 1 February 2010\n\nShe had been a lady-in-waiting and protégée of Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond, and afterwards entered the household of Elizabeth of York, Queen consort of the Countess's son, King Henry VII of England. While at court, she met the scholar and philosopher Erasmus, who was favourably impressed by Joan.Emerson\n\nHer first husband was Sir Richard Guildford, by whom she had her only child, Sir Henry Guildford. Her second husband was Anthony Poyntz.\n\nWhen King Henry VIII was attempting to divorce his first wife, Catherine of Aragon in order to marry Anne Boleyn, Joan gave a deposition, concerning whether or not Catherine's marriage to Arthur, Prince of Wales, had been consummated, in which she confirmed that Prince Arthur and Catherine had lain together \"as man and wife all alone five or six nights after the said marriage\".Emerson\n\nFamily and marriage\nJoan was born in about 1463, the daughter of Sir William Vaux and Katherine Penyston. She had a brother, Sir Nicholas Vaux. In 1471, her father died. On an unknown date, she became a lady-in-waiting and protégée of Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond, and later entered the service of Queen consort, Elizabeth of York, wife of Margaret's son, Henry Tudor.\n\nIn 1489, she married her first husband, Sir Richard Guildford (1455 – 6 September 1506). King Henry and Queen Elizabeth both attended the wedding.Emerson\n\nSir Richard and Joan had one son:\n Sir Henry Guildford (died 1532), courtier, Master of the Horse, and comptroller of the royal household; married twice but had no children by either of his wives.\n\nLady Governess \nBy the year 1499, she served as the Lady Governess to Princesses Margaret and Mary. It was Joan upon whom Princess Mary chiefly relied on as a child.Hester W. Chapman, The Thistle and the Rose, p. 160 She met the Dutch philosopher and humanist Erasmus when he paid a visit to the royal children. Erasmus  referred to Joan in 1519 in a letter to her son, Henry, as \"the noble lady your mother\", wishing her happiness and prosperity.Emerson.\nthumb|Erasmus visiting the children of Henry VII accompanied by Joan Vaux\nShe was summoned to wait upon Queen Elizabeth for the arrival of Catherine of Aragon in 1501.Emerson Shortly before the Infanta's marriage to Prince Arthur, according to The Recyt of the Ladie Kateryne, on 6 November Joan was at Dogmersfield Park and partnered Prince Arthur in a Spanish dance accompanied by Catherine's musicians,Alison Weir, The Six Wives of Henry VIII, p. 30. \"Lady Guildford danced right pleasant and honourably\".Gordon Kipling, The Recyt of the Ladie Kateryne (Oxford, 1990), p. 8 (I/153).\n\nAfter her husband died in Jerusalem in 1506, where he had gone on pilgrimage, she once again entered the household of Margaret Beaufort, where she remained until the latter's death in 1509. By 1510, she had retired from the court, and was living on a small pension in a house in Blackfriars, London. That same year, she inherited a life interest in a house in Southwark, along with lands in Norfolk and Suffolk from Sir Thomas Brandon. She was compelled to pay Brandon's nephew, Sir William Sidney, the sum of 20 marks a year in rent. She leased the Southwark property back to Brandon's heir, Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk.Emerson\n\nIn 1514, she accompanied her former charge, Princess Mary, to France on the occasion of the latter's marriage to King Louis XII.Chapman, p.163 Following the wedding ceremony, when he sent Joan home, along with most of Mary's English attendants, Mary became angry and objected to the dismissal of her \"Mother Guildford\".Debra Barrett-Graves, 'Joan Vaux Guildford Poyntz', Carole Levin, Anna Riehl Bertolet, Jo Eldridge Carney, A Biographical Encyclopedia of Early Modern Englishwomen (Routledge, 2017), p. 471. On 12 October she protested in a letter to Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, writing \"I have not yet seen in France any lady or gentleman so necessary for me as she is\".Emerson In a lengthy, tactfully-written letter, Cardinal Wolsey asked King Louis to recall Joan to Mary's service saying \"I have no doubt, Sire, that when you know her [Joan] well, you will find her a wise, honourable, and discreet lady\".Chapman, p. 173\n\nQueen Mary's protests and Cardinal Wolsey's letter were to no avail, as King Louis had taken an especial dislike to Joan, due to the fact that she had taken it upon herself to rule Mary, and had curtailed Louis's intimacy with his wife, refusing to leave the couple alone with the result that his efforts to establish a relationship with Mary were continually frustrated.Chapman, pp.173-74 Joan was duly sent back to England with the other ladies, and resumed her retirement. In 1515, King Henry VIII granted her two pensions totalling £60 per annum.Emerson In 1519, she was granted for life an annual gift of a tun of duty-free Gascon wine.Emerson\n\nIt is possible that she later returned to court as a lady-in-waiting to Catherine of Aragon.Emerson\n\nThe King's Great Matter \n\nWhen Henry VIII became enamoured of Anne Boleyn and sought to annul his marriage to Catherine of Aragon on the grounds that it was invalid due to Catherine having been his brother's widow (which violated a passage in the Book of Leviticus in the Bible), he sought witnesses to testify that Catherine and Arthur had consummated their marriage. (See main article: Henry VIII of England)\n\nAs a former lady in the household of Elizabeth of York, Joan was summoned to give a deposition as to whether Prince Arthur and Catherine of Aragon had consummated their marriage.Debra Barrett-Graves, 'Joan Vaux Guildford Poyntz', Carole Levin, Anna Riehl Bertolet, Jo Eldridge Carney, A Biographical Encyclopedia of Early Modern Englishwomen (Routledge, 2017), p. 471.  She reported that they had spent their wedding night \"in together in the same bed\", from her personal knowledge; and that she had heard from Queen Elizabeth herself that Arthur and Catherine had lain together \"as man and wife all alone five or six nights after the said marriage\".Emerson\n\nLater years \nJoan married her second husband, Sir Anthony Poyntz, on an unknown date.\n\nIt is recorded that she received several New Year's gifts from Henry VIII, including a garter with a gold buckle and pendant in 1532.Emerson\n\nAfter Poyntz's death in 1533, she retired to the Hospital of St. Mark, a prayer house in Bristol. When this was closed down in 1536, she returned to Blackfriars, where she died on 4 September 1538 at the age of about 75 years. Joan's burial took place on 9 September; she was one of the last people buried in the convent of Blackfriars.Emerson Her only son had died in 1532, without having had children by his two wives. In her last will, which was dated 30 August 1538, she left bequests to her cousin, Sir William Penyston, a niece, Bridget Walsh, her nephew, Lord Vaux, and Maud, her lady fool.",

    "clean_text": "SUPRENUM (, ) was a German research project to develop a parallel computer from 1985 through 1990. It was a major effort which was aimed at developing a national expertise in massively parallel processing both at hardware and at software level.\n\nAlthough the Suprenum-1 computer was the fastest massively parallel MIMD computer in the world during a period in 1992,SUPRENUM: Perspectives and Performance Oliver A. McBryan, 1994 the project was set and is considered a commercial failure.\n\nHistory\nFunded by the Federal Ministry for Research and Technology (BMFT), the SUPRENUM project began in 1985 and BMFT funding continued until 1990 when a fully configured 256-node prototype Suprenum-1 machine was available.\nThe project's inception in 1985 was preceded by a definition phase lasting more than one year in which ideas were gathered, concepts were formed and project partners were selected.\n\nThe project was two-tiered, of which only the first step was taken. In particular it was planned the following:\nSuprenum 1 subproject: production of a high-speed MIMD computer\nSuprenum 2 subproject: expanding the core applications and algorithmic service classes to include complex and dynamic grid structures; data-dependent adaptive procedures, irregular and highly dimensional grids, Monte Carlo methods based on grid structures, non-grid applications, etc., development of innovative language concepts which support automatic load distribution (particularly with dynamic grid structures) to the multiple-processor structure, investigation of alternative interconnecting structures (other topologies, variable interconnection networks) in particular with regard to dynamic grid structures and automatic load distribution strategies, new processor technologies (VLSI, GaAs and so on).\n\nThe mandate accompanying the funding was to create a project that included both a research and a commercial side. To this end, the SUPRENUM Supercomputer GmbH  was founded in Bonn. The SUPRENUM Supercomputer GmbH's charge was to manage the whole enterprise, to contribute to the software effort, to coordinate software developments, and to exploit and market the results of the project. The commercial goal required that companies with manufacturing expertise be involved. The research aspects required that various university and government research laboratories should participate. The final team consisted of about 15 groups from different institutions all over Germany, including several large companies as well as the small SUPRENUM Supercomputer GmbH. \nThey wereSchwerpunkte der Informatikforschung in Deutschland in den 80er Jahren Bernd Reuse, 2008 (German)\nfour (or five, resp.) major research institutes: GMD (, ) both their sites in Sankt Augustin and Berlin, KfA (, ), KfK (, ), DLR\nfive universities: Darmstadt, Bonn, Braunschweig, Düsseldorf, Erlangen-Nürnberg\ntwo industrial users: Dornier, Kraftwerk Union\ntwo companies: Krupp Atlas Elektronik GmbH, Stollmann GmbH\nand Suprenum GmbH\n\nThe tasks were assigned the following:\nIn the applications software area: DLR, Dornier GmbH, the GMD, the Kernforschungsanlage Jülich GmbH (KFA), the Kernforschungsanlage Karlsruhe GmbH (KfK), Kraftwerk Union AG and the University of Düsseldorf.\nIn the language level area: GMD, the Technical University at Darmstadt and the University of Bonn.\nIn the systems area: GMD, Krupp Atlas Elektronik GmbH, Stollmann GmbH, the Technical University at Brunswick and the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg.\n\nWhile the research group on parallel numerical methods in Sankt Augustin provided the know-how for the applications (solving partial differential equations), the German Society for Mathematics and Data Processing GMD FIRST (, ) in Berlin, provided the necessary know-how in hardware and operating system design. \nA total of 15 research groups in academic institutions across Germany were involved in the project. The involvement of the industry was limited to the production of hardware at Krupp Atlas Elektronik.\n\nOnly five systems were shipped.Massiv Paralleles Rechnen (Sendungsarchiv) May 12, 2008 at cczwei.de (German)\n\nSince Jul 12, 2010 SUPRENUM Supercomputer GmbH ist defunct.SUPRENUM Supercomputer at wirtschaft.ch\n\nAfter the end of the SUPRENUM project, Pallas GmbHHomepage of Pallas GmbH evolved out of the remains of SUPRENUM GmbH in 1991. In 2003, the company sold its high performance computing division to the Intel Corporation.\n\nIn contrast to the then ubiquitous, conventional vector computers (e.g. NEC SX architecture, Cray Y-MP), SUPRENUM-1 pursued as one of the first a massively parallel design. However, competitors like Thinking Machines Corporation were catching up fast.\n\nArchitecture\nthumb|SUPRENUM-1 Supercomputer\nThe Suprenum-1 was designed as a massively parallel MIMD multi-computer system and it was based on a distributed hardware architecture.\n\nIt was scalable up to 256 computing nodes, organized into clusters.\nThe nodes of a cluster were partitioned into five function units. From a total of 20 nodes, for the execution of application programs, 16 application nodes were available. One stand-by node served for fault-tolerant purposes. In addition to these application-oriented nodes, the disk node provided for disk I/O services and the diagnostic node provided for maintenance services. And finally, the inter-connection of different clusters, as well as the inter-connection to host machines, is made feasible by the communication node, which actually serves as a gateway between cluster bus and SUPRENUM bus.PEACE: A Distributed Operating System for High-Performance Multi-Computer Systems W. Schröder, 1989\n\nThe first release consisted of 320 nodes (256 application nodes and 64 maintenance nodes).\n\nThe main components of each application node were a 32-bit microprocessor Motorola 68020 operating at a clock rate of 20 MHz, 8 MByte of main memory, protected by 2-bit error-detection and 1-bit error-correction logic, and four coprocessors:Monitoring Program Behaviour on SUPRENUM M. Siegle et al., 1992\n The paged memory management unit (PMMU) Motorola 68851 checked access rights and page violation when the node memory was being accessed by the CPU or at the beginning of DMA.\n The floating-point unit (FPU) Motorola 68882 executed scalar floating-point arithmetic.\n The vector floating-point unit (VFPU) consisted of the Weitek chip set WTL2264/2265 and 64 KByte of fast static memory (vector cache). Peak performance was 10 MFlops for single-operation double-precision floating point computations, and 20 MFlops in the case of chained operations. Peak performance was achieved even if one of the two operands was being read from main memory by DMA, provided a constant increment was used.\n The communication unit (CU) was a microprogrammable coprocessor which took care of the data transfer between a node's main memory and other nodes in the system. The CPU initiated the communication. The communication unit then handled the entire data transfer including bus request, transfer with protocol checks, and bus release. The functions of the communication unit were realized mainly by gate arrays and hybrid modules.\n\nThe net performance of each application node was specified with 4 Mflops. As a consequence, a net performance of 1 Gflops was calculated for the SUPRENUM release .\n\nthumb|Image of a Suprenum-1 node\n\nThe 16 clusters were connected by a network of 200 Mbit/sec busses. The busses were arranged as a rectangular grid with 4 horizontal and 4 vertical busses (global busses). Each cluster consisted of 16 processors connected by a fast bus, along with I/O devices for communication to the global bus grid, to the disk and the host computers. There was a dedicated disk for each cluster. Individual nodes could deliver up to 20 Mflops (64-bit chained) or 10 Mflops (64-bit unchained) of computing power.Scaling Performance of the Shallow Water Equations on the Suprenum-l Supercomputer Oliver A. McBryan, 1992\n\nThe high bandwidth of the bus network made the Suprenum-1 an interesting machine for a wide range of applications, including those requiring long-range communication. No more than three communication steps were ever required between remote nodes. \nSUPRENUM supported a send/receive model of communication. The primary difference is that SUPRENUM Fortran was an extension of standard Fortran, in which task control and communication are incorporated into the language, rather than being implemented through library calls as on the iPSC.\nSUPRENUM also supports Fortran 90 array extensions which avail of the vector hardware. \nSUPRENUM software was characterized by the best support for scientific applications to be found among the various distributed memory MIMD vendors. The effort invested in development of libraries of high-level grid and communication primitives greatly eased the effort of moving applications to the computer, and also provides substantial high-level portability to other systems, since the communication library could be implemented in terms of low level primitives on any distributed system.A Comparison of the Intel iPSC/860 and the Suprenum-1 Parallel Computers  Oliver A. McBryan, 1990\n\nBesides the hardware development, Suprenum-1 software was developed on many levels:\nOperating System\nVectorizing Compilers\nMessage Passing\nApplications\nThe operating system for Suprenum-1 was PEACE (Process Execution And Communication Environment), a new operating system developed specifically for the project. \nPEACE was designed from the start to support efficient low-latency message passing as weIl as multitasking. While PEACE appeared to be a satisfactory operating system, message latency never was as low as desired. Typical latency overheads are of order 1 millisecond. While asynchronous communication was a design goal for SUPRENUM, we were never able to overlap communication with computation on Suprenum-1 due to a mailbox conflict within PEACE.\n\nAs a major result, a rudimentary and \"first-of-its-kind\" Fortran compiler was developed. Based on Fortran 77, it already provided some features of the then upcoming Fortran 90 standard. It also used the PARMACS (\"parallel macros\") communication library. In contrast to the above-mentioned FORTRAN compiler, PARMACS programming model is explicitly based on Message Passing. \nBut again, funding for the project was stopped before the compiler had reached maturity. It transformed into the SUPERBScience&Technology Europe - FRG's \"Suprenum\" Supercomputer Sept 7, 1989 (SUprenum  Bonn) project (\"Vienna Fortran\").\n\nPerformance\nThe tableParallel Processing and Scientific Applications C. Farhat  and  O. McBryan, 1992 below provides a comparison of the Suprenum-1 with other MPP systems of its time:\n\nSystemNumber of nodesPeak Performance [Mflops] Meiko CS-1 16 960 Suprenum-1 256 5120 Intel iPSC/860   128 7680 Thinking Machines Corp.

Continuity is an essential prerequisite for software development or applied industrial use.\n\nIn hindsight, especially the inadequate involvement of industry is being criticized. However, as a research project itself, SUPRENUM was successful.\nThe participating institutions had acquired a well-respected expertise in parallel computing, which resulted in a European project GENESIS. PEACE served as an operating system for the non-profit MANNA architecture. SUPRENUM also influenced the development of other parallel computers such as the Meiko CS-2 which was an outcome of the European GENESIS project.\n\nThe SUPRENUM project has spun off many successful enterprises, e.g. GENESIS, SUPERB, Pallas GmbH, Manna, PPPE and RAPS. Pallas, in fact, can be seen as a continuation of all of the software aspects of SUPRENUM, and as such shows that this part of SUPRENUM was commercially successful. The GMD FIRST project Manna is similarly a continuation of the operating system and some of the architecture aspects of SUPRENUM, again very successful, although this time in a research environment.\n\nAlso the Meiko CS-2 machine, originally developed within GENESIS, involved many elements of the Suprenum-2 design from SUPRENUM, and indeed there were serious plans at one point to merge Meiko and SUPRENUM. Unfortunately, this concept was ultimately rejected by the shareholders of SUPRENUM GmbH, who at that time also decided to withdraw from SUPRENUM. Finally the applications' side of SUPRENUM evolved into GENESIS, later PPPE and RAPS, so that again this aspect of SUPRENUM has shown itself to be of long-term viability.\n\nTaking into account all of these achievements across a broad spectrum of computing technology, one can only conclude that SUPRENUM was highly successful, even while not achieving all of the goals originally established by the government.",

    "clean_text": "Webtag is an on-line bioinformatics tool providing oligonucleotide sequences (usually called tags or anchors) that are absent from a specified genome. These tags can be appended to gene specific primers for reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) experiments, circumventing genomic DNA contamination.\n\nBackground\nRT-PCR is a technique used for the detection of even very low copy mRNA transcripts. The sensitivity of the technique also makes it susceptible to DNA contamination. Since PCR is unable to distinguish between cDNA targets and genomic DNA contamination, false positives and/or erroneous quantitative results are possible.\n\nIn order to overcome genomic DNA contamination in transcriptional studies, reverse template-specific polymerase chain reaction, a modification of RT-PCR is used. The possibility of using tags whose sequences are not found in the genome further improves reverse specific polymerase chain reaction experiments. The use of anchors, or tags, in the 5' region of a gene specific primer or poly-T tail allows for RNA-specific amplification, and constitutes a viable strategy. Techniques such as RS-PCR and (EXACT) RT-PCR are based on the integration of such tags (unique sequences not present in genomic DNA) in the 5' end of the first strand cDNA, permitting RNA-specific amplification without loss of sensitivity.\n\nWebtag\nThis web based service builds on the Tagenerator tool, but is very fast because all tags are pre-generated and stored in a database. It is also a significant improvement since Webtag takes into account the interactions of the tag with the primers to be used in the experiment. Having it as a web based service also means that the molecular biologist doesn't have to download and install software with all the dependencies on their own computer.\n\nWebtag generates tags that combine genome absence with good priming properties for RT-PCR based experiments. The use of such tags will deliberately not result in PCR amplification of genomic DNA, permitting the exclusive amplification of cDNA, therefore circumventing the effects of genomic DNA contamination in an RNA sample.",

    "title": "Party of Civic Understanding",
    "clean_text": "The Party of Civic Understanding (, SOP) was a centre-left political party in Slovakia between 1998 and 2003. Between 1998 and 2002 the party was part of the coalition government led by Mikuláš Dzurinda, with the founder of the party, Rudolf Schuster, being elected President of Slovakia in 1999.\n\nIn government the party lost support and after the 2002 election had no seats in parliament. The party dissolved on the 1 March 2003 and recommended its members join Direction – Social Democracy (SMER).\n\nFoundation and 1998 election\n150px|thumb|right|Rudolf Schuster, founder and first leader of the Party of Civic Understanding\nThe Party of Civic Understanding was founded in February 1998 by the Mayor of Košice, Rudolf Schuster. Members of the new party included the former Foreign Minister Pavol Hamžík, among other prominent Slovak figures. The new party was aided by favourable publicity from the Markíza television station.\n\nThe Party of Civic Understanding aimed for left leaning voters from eastern Slovakia and disillusioned supporters of the governing People's Party – Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS). The party called for pensioners and students to get a better standard of living, but did not call for privatisations to be re-done without conditions, thereby getting some support from businessmen. It was also a strong supporter of membership of the European Union and NATO.\n\nThe party's aim initially was to reduce the polarisation of Slovak politics, by promoting reconciliation between the government of Vladimír Mečiar and the opposition. However, as the European Union was completely opposed to the HZDS of Vladimír Mečiar, the Party of Civic Understanding refused to consider co-operating with the HZDS in government. Instead the Party of Civic Understanding joined with the other opposition parties in discussion of the upcoming election campaign and a possible coalition after the election.\n\nTwo polls in June and July 1998 showed the Party of Civic Understanding in third place with either 14.2% or 18.4% of the vote, with the party leader Rudolph Schuster being the most popular figure in the country. However at the September 1998 parliamentary election the Party of Civic Understanding won only 8% of the vote and gained 13 seats in parliament, the fewest any of the parties which won seats at the election. The under performance by the party was put down to attacks by Slovenská televízia, the state television station, and possibly voter dislike of the negative campaign by the party.\n\nGovernment\nFollowing the 1998 election, the Party of Civic Understanding joined a coalition government with the Slovak Democratic Coalition (SDK), Party of the Democratic Left (SDL) and the Party of the Hungarian Coalition (SMK), after refusing an approach from the HZDS. The party got 2 ministerial posts in the new government, European Integration and Privatisation and a deputy prime minister. In return for not taking a third ministry, they got agreement that all the government parties would support Rudolf Schuster to become the next president.\n\nThe new government had a three-fifths majority in parliament and so was able to amend the constitution to provide for the direct election of the president, instead of the previous election by parliament. As part of the coalition agreement, the leader of the Party of Civic Understanding, Rudolf Schuster, was the candidate of the coalition government for president at the 1999 election. Schuster led the first round with 47.4% of the vote and was elected president at the run-off, defeating the former Prime Minister Vladimír Mečiar by 57.2% to 42.8%.\n\nFollowing the presidential election, Pavol Hamžík was elected the new leader of the party in June 1999. However the party lost support in government and after the formation of Direction – Social Democracy in November 1999, the Party of Civic Understanding was at less than 5% in the polls. By 2002 the founder of Markíza, Pavol Rusko, no longer supported the Party of Civic Understanding and instead created his own party, Alliance of the New Citizen.\n\n2002 election and merger\nAt the September 2002 election the Party of Civic Understanding competed on a joint list with the Party of the Democratic Left, but with only 19 places on the candidate list, compared to 108 for the Party of the Democratic Left. Before signing the agreement the Party of Civic Understanding was only getting 1% in an April 2002 opinion poll. However even combined they only won 1.36% at the election and thus got no seats in parliament.\n\nOn the 1 March 2003 delegates at an extraordinary congress of the Party of Civic Understanding voted for the party to dissolve. They called on all 5,000 members to join Direction – Social Democracy, while the leader of the Party of Civic Understanding, Pavol Hamžík, signed an agreement on cooperation with the leader of Direction – Social Democracy Robert Fico.\n\nLeaders \n\nLeaderPeriodRudolf Schuster1998–1999Pavol Hamžík1999–2003\n\nElection results\nNational Council\n Election Leader Votes % Rank Seats +/– Government 1998 Rudolf Schuster 269,343 8.02  #6  New  2002 Pavol Hamžík 39,163 1.36 #12   13 rowspan=2 \n\nPresidential\n Election Candidate First round Second round Result Votes % Votes % 1999 Rudolf Schuster 1,396,950 47.37 1,727,481 57.18",

    "clean_text": "The Constitutional Court of Slovenia (in Slovene: Ustavno sodišče Republike Slovenije, US RS) is a special court established by the Slovenian Constitution. Since its inception, the Court has been located in the city of Ljubljana. It is the highest court in the country for reviewing the constitutionality and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, otherwise the highest court in the country is the Supreme Court of the Republic of Slovenia. The constitutional court is not part of any branch of government (not even the judiciary) and is an independent state body.Zakon o ustavnem sodišču\n\nThe main responsibilities of the Constitutional Court include:\n\n reviewing the constitutionality and legality of laws and other regulations, \n deciding on constitutional complaints (violations of human rights) against the decisions of other state bodies, \n and certain other responsibilities related to elections and jurisdiction.\nThe seat of the Court is in Ljubljana in a Plečnik's Palace, designed by a famous Slovenian architect Jože Plečnik.\n\nJurisdiction\nMost powers of the Constitutional Court are explicitly determined by the Constitution. In accordance with the Constitution (§160), the Constitutional Court decides on:\n\n the conformity of laws with the Constitution and of laws and other regulations with ratified treaties and with the general principles of international law;\n the conformity of regulations with the Constitution and with laws;\n the conformity of local community regulations with the Constitution and with laws;\n the conformity of general acts issued for the exercise of public authority with the Constitution, laws, and regulations;\n constitutional complaints stemming from the violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms by individual acts;\n on jurisdictional disputes between the state and local communities and among local communities themselves; between courts and other state authorities; and between the National Assembly, the President of the Republic, and the Government;\n the unconstitutionality of the acts and activities of political parties;\n other matters vested by the Constitution (e.g. deciding on an impeachment charges against the prime minister or president; conformity of international treaties with the Constitution before its ratification; appeals against a National Assembly decision on the election of Slovenian members to the European Parliament; admissibility of a National Assembly decision not to call a referendum on the confirmation of constitutional amendments; ).https://www.us-rs.si/media/constitution.pdf\n\nProcedures \n\nThe Constitutional Court has several strictly defined procedures in which cases may be brought before it. Procedures are regulated by the Constitutional Court Act.\n\nConstitutional Court decides by a majority vote of all its judges unless otherwise provided for individual cases by the Constitution or law. Decisions of the Court are binding for all.\n\n Procedure for the review of the constitutionality and legality \nThe procedure for the review of the constitutionality and legality of regulations and general acts issued for the exercise of public authority is initiated by:\n\n submission of a written request by an applicant (specific state bodies); or\n by a Constitutional Court order on the acceptance of a petition by a private citizen, whose legal interests were affected, to initiate a review procedure.\n\nWritten request can be submitted by any court, the National Assembly, one third of MPs, the National Council, the Government, the Ombudsman, the Information Commissioner, the Bank of Slovenia, the State Prosecutor General, representative bodies of local communities, a representative association of local communities, and national representative trade unions.\n\nIn this procedure the Court may:\n\n find that the law or other regulation is in conformity with the Constitution or law;\n in whole or in part abrogate an Act which is not in conformity with the Constitution;\n annul or abrogate other regulations (Act cannot be annulled or abrogated).\n\n Constitutional complaint \nConstitutional complaint is possible in case of to a violation of human rights or fundamental freedoms against individual acts of state or local authorities.\n\nA complaint may be lodged by:\n\n an individual whose were violated,; or\n the Ombudsman in connection with an individual case that he is dealing with.\n\nComplaint is not allowed until after all legal remedies have been exhausted.\n\nIn this procedure the Court may:\n\n dismiss a constitutional complaint as unfounded;\n in whole or in part annuls or abrogates the individual act, and remands the case to the authority competent to decide thereon.\n\nLandmark decisions \nTito street decision, U-I-109/10 of 3 October 2011.\n\nComposition \nThe court consists of 9 judges, who are elected by the National Assembly of the Republic of Slovenia for a non-renewable 9-year term on the proposal of the President of the Republic. Before replacing a judge after the end of their term, a new judge must first be elected. If this does not happen by the end of the judge's term, that judge's term will be extended until a new judge is elected (e.g. judge Dunja Jadek Pensa served for more than 10 years before political consensus was reached to elect judge Rok Svetlič in 2021).\n\nJudges are elected from among legal experts, who are Slovenian citizens and at least 40 years of age, but they do not have to meet the conditions that apply to the election of judges of regular courts. Among other things, the judges of the Constitutional Court do not need a state legal exam, which allows, for example, university professors to be elected as judges of the court.\n\nAfter election, a new judge must take the following oath before the National Assembly: \"I swear that I shall judge according to the Constitution, the law, and my conscience and that I shall strive with all my power for constitutionality, legality, and the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms.\"\n\nJudges elect a president and vice-president of the Court among themselves for a term of three years by a secret ballot.\n\n List of judges \n+#JudgeTermSuccessionNominated byOther positions1Janez Šinkovec(1928-2016)25 June 19918 January 19981President Milan Kučan2Lovro Šturm(1938-2021)25 June 199119 December 19981President of the Court (1997-1998)3Peter Jambrek(1940-)25 June 199119 December 19981President of the Court (1991-1994)4Anton Perenič(1941-)25 June 199130 September 199215Anton (Tone) Jerovšek(1941-)25 June 199119 December 19981President of the Court (1994-1997)6Matevž Krivic(1942-)25 June 199119 December 199817Janez Snoj(1934-2005)12 February 199231 March 199818Lojze Ude(1936-)25 May 199324 May 200219Boštjan M.

His coronation took place after the victorious battle of Lafaruug, in which Guled Abdi successfully led the Isaaq and was crowned by the Isaaq clan after defeating the Absame tribes. After witnessing his leadership and courage, the Isaaq chiefs recognized his father Abdi who refused to adopt the Sultan title instead preferring his son Guled. Guled would be crowned the first Sultan of the Isaaq clan. Sultan Guled thus ruled the Isaaq up until his death in the early 19th century, where he was succeeded by his eldest son Farah.\n\n \nThe Isaaq Sultanate was established and based at Toon. Lieutenant C.P Rigby in the year 1848 writes about the capital of the Isaaq:The Hubr Gajis tribe and its different branches are governed by two Sultans, named Sultan Deriah [Habr Yunis Sultan] and Sultan Farah: the residence of the latter is at Toro.The Transactions of the Bombay Geographical Society 1850, Volume 9, p.133",

    "title": "Istrian Demarcation",
    "clean_text": "thumb|Istrian Demarcation, State Archive in Rijeka\nThe Istrian Demarcation or Istrian Perambulation () is a legal document on the demarcation of territories between neighbouring municipalities in Istria,  currently shared by Croatia, Slovenia, and Italy. More precisely, between the possessions of the Patriarchate of Aquileia, the Count of Gorica and Pazin and the representatives of the Venetian Republic. In addition to the borders that were being agreed upon only in disputed parts of Istria, the Istrian Demarcation also established the payment of fees for the use of forests, vineyards and pastures.\n\nAlthough the document gives a date of 1325, this is sometimes corrected to 1275 on the basis of other internal evidence.Tomaž Keresteš and Borut Holcman (2015), \"The Istrian Perambulation as an Important Source on History of Autonomous Communes in Slovenian Istria\", Lex Localis – Journal of Local Self-Government, Vol. 13, No. 1, pp. 49–57.\n\nAuthenticity\nThe authenticity of the Istrian Demarcation is disputed. The original document does not survive, only later copies. The earliest copies are in the Croatian language and Glagolitic script and date to the 16th century. All Italian and Latin copies are based on a Croatian Glagolitic version. There are definite discrepancies in the surviving text.\n\nCarlo De Franceschi rejected it. Pietro Kandler, recognizing the discrepancies, still accepted the document as basically genuine. Milko Kos and  rejected its genuineness, arguing that it was fabricated in Habsburg Istria in the mid-15th century on the basis of several authentic records of perambulations found in the archives. Croatian historiography in general has sought to vindicate the document. Luka Kirac, Branko Fučić and Josip Bratulić all argued for its value as a historical source, even if partially falsified. Bratulić, especially, has argued that even if fabricated during a border dispute, it must contain accurate material to have had any credibility whatsoever.\n\nOrigin \nThe document was probably the result of separates documents being combined into the Istrian Demarcation in 1325. A commission to map and record the borders was established. The scribes of the commission were three: one to write the data in Latin, one to write it in German and one to write the data in Croatian. The data used by the commission were old documents of individual municipalities or labels found on the trees and rocks that were used for demarcation purposes. In addition, witnesses were questions on memory of the borders under oath.\n\nThere are no 14th century originals but two copies are preserved, both in Croatian (one found in Momjan, the other in Kršan). The original text in Croatian was written in the Glagolitic script by a priest called Mikul from Gologorica. The copy from Kršan was written in 1502, and is kept at the University Library in Zagreb. It was written by Levac Križanić. The copy from Momjan was also supposedly written by Kižanić.\n\nContents \nThe Istrian Demarcation vaguely shows us the social organization, economic conditions and life of the rural communities in medieval Istria. The document was often claimed as unauthentic, mostly because of political reasons. The modern edition was first published by Ante Starčević in 1852.\n\nThe language of the document is not very different from other Croatian medieval legal texts, that is, the non-liturgical texts written in standard Chakavian with a low degree of Church Slavonic influence. However, even the younger copies retain some older features of Croatian (e.g. the dual form of some nouns) and minor traceas of Church Slavonic (e.g. the use of absolute construction of the dative case). The Demarcation is also famous for referring to Croatian as hrvacki:  I ondi gospodin Menart sluga naprid sta i pokaza listi prave v keh se udržahu zapisani razvodi i kunfini meju Sovińakom z Vrhom i Plzetom, ki bihu pisani na let Božjih 1195, ke listi ondi pred nas trih nodari postaviše, keh ta gospoda izibra: jednoga latinskoga, a drugoga nimškoga, a tretoga hrvackoga, da imamo vsaki na svoj orijinal pisat, poimeno od mesta do mesta, kako se niže udrži, po vsoj deželi. I tako mi niže imenovani nodari preda vsu tu gospodu pročtesmo kako se v ńih udrži. I tako onde obe strane se sjediniše i kuntentaše i kordaše i razvodi svojimi zlameniji postaviše, i jednoj i drugoj strani pisaše listi jazikom latinskim i hrvackim, a gospoda sebe shraniše jazikom nemškim.Historian Dražen Vlahov says ‘The Croatian Glagolitic document of the demarcation of the holdings of certain Istrian municipalities, i.e. of their feudal lords (Duke Albrecht of Pazin and Gorica, Patriarch Raimund of Aquileia and Venetian authorities in Istria), also known as the Istrian Demarcation, originally dated 5 May 1325, and written, as stated in the text, in three languages (Latin, German and Croatian) in three originals, written by three selected scribes: a priest called Mikula for Duke Albrecht who wrote in Croatian in the Glagolitic script, Mr Pernar from Gorica who wrote in German and Mr Ivan from Krmina who wrote it in Latin. All three specimens are considered original. None of the original documents were preserved but two copies were preserved in cursive Glagolitic in Croatian, three copies in Latin and several copies in Italian. According to experts, the Latin and Italian copies were made on the basis of the translation of the Croatian-Glagolitic specimens.’\n\nVlahov denies the claims of Milko Kos and Josip Bratulić that the Croatian Glagolitic copy of the Istrian Demarcation, found in Momjan in Istria in 1880, was written by an unknown author on the basis of an unpreserved copy of the notary Levac Križanić. The analysis the manuscripts of both Glagolitic copies of the Istrian Demarcation (one from Momjan and one from Kršan) written in Glagolitic cursive script concludes that both Croatian copies of the document in question were written by the same person, i.e. Levac Križanić, and that the unanalysed copy from Momjan originated before the Kršan copy, probably in 1530s.",

    "clean_text": "Tom Tom Tomcat is a 1953 Warner Bros. Merrie Melodies animated short directed by Friz Freleng. The short was released on June 27, 1953, and stars Tweety and Sylvester.\n\nPlot\nIn the Wild West, Granny and Tweety are riding through the desert in their wagon, singing Oh! Susanna, when they are suddenly ambushed by a large group of \"puddy tats\" posing as Indians – many of whom appear to be clones of Sylvester. They flee to a deserted fort, where Granny begins to shoot them down while Tweety uses tally marks to keep track of how many Indians have been beaten, singing Ten Little Indians. The tenth one nearly takes Tweety away, but he is struck down by Granny just in time.\n\nMore attempts include an archer and a battering ram, both foiled. Another archer almost drags Tweety out again (“Granny! Help! A Mohican got me!”), but Granny surprises him with a bomb instead. The cats’ attempts continue like this, all of them backfiring or being foiled. In one instance, Chief “Rain-In-The-P-P-Puss” orders the real Sylvester to sneak into the fort, but Sylvester emerges later with the top of his head having been scalped off by Granny (“Ya got any more bright ideas?”).\n\nFinally, Granny and Tweety disguise themselves as fellow Indians and lead the cats into the powder house. When one of them (named Geronimo) asks for a match, they kindly oblige, and the powder house explodes, causing all the cats to erupt into the sky and then fall. Holding an umbrella, Tweety comments: “Oh my goodness, it’s raining puddy tats!”",

    "clean_text": "Roccella is a genus of 23 species of lichens in the family Roccellaceae. The genus was circumscribed by Swiss botanist Augustin Pyramus de Candolle in 1805, with Roccella fuciformis as the type species.\n\nDescription\nRoccella presents a fruticose (shrub-like), thallus that is either erect or  (hanging) with sparse  branching. The main and terminal , varying in shape from flattened to rounded (), typically measure 2 to 5 mm (up to 10 mm) in thickness and 5 to 15 cm in length. These branches has colours ranging from creamy white-greyish to greyish-brown and have surfaces that are either smooth or wrinkled, with some being sparsely  (powdery) or lacking pruina (epruinose). Soredia, reproductive propagules for asexual reproduction, are present in many species within the genus.\n\nThe  of Roccella lichens is made of hyphae that are arranged in an  manner and are about 40 to 70 μm thick. The medulla (the inner layer) is loosely structured above, having a byssoid (fibrous) or chalky texture, and below it becomes  (tightly packed cells) near the basal plate (holdfast) area, often showing a (yellowish) brown colouration. These lichens primarily associate with the photobiont Trentepohlia, with no secondary  present. They attach to surfaces using holdfasts, including a hypomedulla which usually appears brown to dark brown, sometimes with a yellowish tinge.\n\nThe ascomata (spore-producing structures) of Roccella are in the form of apothecia, lateral, and circular in outline. They can be either immersed in the thallus or sessile with a constricted base and can reach up to 2.5 mm in diameter. The  of the apothecia is exposed, white, and features a , pruinose layer. The  (the outer layer of the ascomata) initially contains algae and a cortex, but over time, the algae may be displaced, and the cortex eroded. The  forms a thin  and is sometimes inconspicuous.\n\nThe  (upper layer of the ascomata) is about 40 to 50 μm high, brown, with intertwined  (supporting structures in the hymenium) that are sparsely branched. The hymenium (spore-bearing layer) itself is 70 to 90 μm high. Paraphysoids within the hymenium are sparsely branched, hyaline (translucent), and measure 1 to 2 μm in diameter. The  (layer beneath the hymenium) is distinct, dark brown, , and does not extend into the medulla. The asci (spore-bearing cells) are  (club-shaped), measuring 60 to 85 by 12 to 14 μm.  are  (spindle-shaped), curved, smooth, contains three septa (internal partitions), and are hyaline.\n\n (asexual reproductive structures) are pycnidial (flask-shaped), solitary, immersed in the thallus, and black, measuring about 0.1 mm in diameter. The  (asexual spores) are  (thread-like), curved, measuring 16 to 21 by less than 1 μm. In terms of chemistry, Roccella lichens contain orcinol and β-orcinol depsides, as well as aliphatic acids. Roccella lichens grow on rock or on bark.\n\nSpecies\nRoccella albida \nRoccella bajasurensis \nRoccella botrytis \nRoccella colonii \nRoccella elisabethae \nRoccella floreana \nRoccella floribrassica \nRoccella fuciformis \nRoccella fusca \nRoccella galapagoensis \nRoccella geniculata  – Galápagos Islands\nRoccella glebaria  – Galápagos Islands\nRoccella gracilis \nRoccella hertelii \nRoccella incurvata \nRoccella kappeniana  – Galápagos Islands\nRoccella maderensis \nRoccella minuta \nRoccella montagnei \nRoccella phycopsioides \nRoccella phycopsis \nRoccella sanctae-helenae \nRoccella stipitata  – Galápagos Islands\nRoccella tinctoria \nRoccella translucida",

    "title": "Religion in the Middle East",
    "clean_text": "For approximately a millennium, the Abrahamic religions have been predominant throughout all of the Middle East. The Abrahamic tradition itself and the three best-known Abrahamic religions originate from the Middle East: Judaism and Christianity emerged in the Levant in the 6th century BCE and the 1st century CE, respectively, while Islam emerged in Arabia in the 7th century CE.\n\nToday, Islam is the region's dominant religion, being adhered to by at least 90% of the population in every Middle Eastern country except for Jewish-majority Israel, religiously diverse Lebanon and Christian-majority Cyprus. Muslims constitute 18% of the total Israeli population, ~67% of the Lebanese population (estimates vary) and 25% of the total Cypriot population, or approximately 2% if Northern Cyprus is excluded from this figure.Pew Research Center's Religion & Public Life Project: Cyprus. Pew Research Center. 2010.\n\nThere are a number of minority religions present in the Middle East, belonging to the Abrahamic tradition or other religious categories, such as the Iranian religions. These include the Baháʼí Faith, Druzism, Bábism, Yazidism, Gnosticism, Rastafari, Mandaeism, Manichaiesm, Yarsanism, Samaritanism, Ishikism, Ali-Ilahism,Yazdânism, Sabianism, Shabakism, and Zoroastrianism. While contemporary Middle Eastern religious practices are overwhelmingly monotheistic, most of the region's ancient traditions were polytheistic, including the Semitic religions, the Egyptian religion, the Greek religion, and various Iranian religions.\n\nAbrahamic religions \n\n Islam \n\nIslam is the most widely followed religion in the Middle East. About 20% of the world's Muslims live in the Middle East, and about 85 percent of people in the Middle East are Muslim. Islam is a monotheistic religion, teaching belief in one God (Allah) and is based on the Quran. Muslims believe that Muhammad is the final prophet of God in a long chain of prophets, from Adam on down to John the Baptist, Jesus, and finally Muhammad. The majority of the Muslims are Sunni, followed by Shi'a. Smaller sects include Ibadism, Sufism, non-denominational, the Ahmadiyya.See, for example: However, Ahmadis are considered by the majority of Muslims as heretical.Ahmadis - Oxford Islamic Studies Online\n\nA major source of conflict in the Muslim Middle East is the divisive nature between the two main sects of Islam: Sunni and Shi'a. Although these two sects agree on the fundamentals of Islam and the teachings of the Quran, they are in conflict about who would lead the Muslim community after Muhammad's death. The Battle of Siffin and the Battle of Karbala caused a significant schism between the two sects. Throughout the years, other differences have arisen between practices, beliefs and culture. Many conflicts between the two communities have occurred.\n+CountryTotal PopulationMuslim PercentageMuslim Population1,505,00373.7%1,109,187854,80018.0%153,864109,546,72090%98,592,04881,871,50098%80,234,07039,339,75397.0%38,159,5608,930,68017.7%1,580,73010,261,30094.0%9,645,6224,420,11074.6%3,297,4026,093,50955%3,515,9554,664,84485.9%4,007,1014,780,97893.0%4,446,3092,561,64367.7%1,734,23233,413,66093.0%31,000,00018,284,40787.0%15,907,43480,810,52592%74,196,9919,992,08376%7,593,98328,915,28499.1%28,655,046Middle East419,425,72891.17%382,425,728\n\n Sunni \n\nSunni Islam is the largest branch of Islam in most countries in the Middle East. According to Sunni traditions, Muhammad left no successor and the participants of the Saqifah event appointed Abu Bakr as the next-in-line (the first caliph).\n\nThe Quran, together with hadith (especially those collected in Kutub al-Sittah) and binding juristic consensus, form the basis of all traditional jurisprudence within Sunni Islam. Sharia rulings are derived from these basic sources, in conjunction with analogical reasoning, consideration of public welfare and juristic discretion, using the principles of jurisprudence developed by the traditional legal schools. In matters of creed, the Sunni tradition upholds the six pillars of imān (faith) and comprises the Ash'ari and Maturidi schools of Kalam (theology) as well as the textualist school known as traditionalist theology.\n\n Shia \n\nShīʿa Islam or Shīʿīsm is the second-largest branch of Islam. Although there are many Shia subsects, modern Shia Islam has been divided into three main groupings: Twelvers, Ismailis and Zaidis, with Twelvers being the largest and most influential group, making up perhaps 85 percent of Shias.Tabataba'i (1979), p. 76God's rule: the politics of world religions, p. 146, Jacob Neusner, 2003Esposito, John. What Everyone Needs to Know about Islam, Oxford University Press, 2002. . p.40\nTwelver Shia have their largest populations in the Middle East in Iran (75%), Iraq (45%), Bahrain (35-40%), Azerbaijan (75%), Kuwait (15%), Yemen (30%), Syria (12.5%) Lebanon (20%), Saudi Arabia (8%), Oman (6%), UAE (5%), Turkey (12.5%), Qatar (5%).\n\nThe schism between Shi'as and Sunnis happened after the death of Muhammad. Members of the 'ummah' who later on became representatives of the Shi'ita branch preferred Abu Bakr over Ali ibn Abi Talib, as the successor of the Prophet and as the rightful rulers of the Muslim community. Abu Bakr was appointed caliph by senior Muslims, while Ali ibn Abi Talib was the cousin and son-in-law of Muhammad.\n\n Zaydi \n\nFollowers of the Zaydi Islamic jurisprudence are called Zaydi Shi'a and make up about 30% of Muslims in Yemen. Zaidis emerged in the eighth century out of Shi'a Islam. They are named after Zayd ibn ʻAlī, the grandson of Husayn ibn ʻAlī who they recognize as the fifth Imam.\n\n Alawites \n\nthumb|alt=Large group of people looking at the camera|Alawites celebrating at a festival in Baniyas, Syria during World War II.\nAlawis, also rendered as Alawites, Alawīyyah or Nusạyriyya, is a syncretic sect of the Twelver branch of Shia Islam, primarily centered in Syria. The eponymously named Alawites revere Ali (Ali ibn Abi Talib), considered the 1st Imam of the Twelver school. However, they are generally considered to be Ghulat by most other sects of Shia Islam. The sect is believed to have been founded by Ibn Nusayr during the 9th century, and fully established as a religion, For this reason, Alawites are sometimes called Nusayris ( Nuṣayrīyyah), although the term has come to be used as a pejorative in the modern era. Another name, Ansari ( Anṣāriyyah), is believed to be a mistransliteration of Nusayri. Today, Alawites represent 11 percent of the Syrian population and are a significant minority in Turkey and northern Lebanon. There is also a population living in the village of Ghajar in the Golan Heights. They are often confused with the Alevis of Turkey. Alawites form the dominant religious group on the Syrian coast and towns near the coast which is also inhabited by Sunnis, Christians, and Ismailis.\n\nAlawites have historically kept their beliefs secret from outsiders and non-initiated Alawites.Friedman, Nuṣayrī-ʿAlawīs, 2010: p.68Friedman, Nuṣayrī-ʿAlawīs, 2010: p.67 At the core of Alawite belief is a divine triad, comprising three aspects of the one God.\n\nAlawites have traditionally lived in the An-Nusayriyah Mountains along the Mediterranean coast of Syria. Latakia and Tartus are the region's principal cities. They are also concentrated in the plains around Hama and Homs. Alawites also live in Syria's major cities, and are estimated at 12 percent of the country's population (2.6 million, out of a total population of 22 million).\n\n Alevism \n\nthumb|Kartal Cemevi in Istanbul.\nAlevism is a small syncretic, heterodox  form of Islam, following Shia, Sufi, Sunni and local traditions, whose adherents follow the mystical (bāṭenī) teachings of Ali, the Twelve Imams, and a descendant—the 13th century Alevi saint Haji Bektash Veli. There are between 8–12 million Alevi and they are found primarily in Turkey among ethnic Turks and Kurds, and make up between 10 and 15% of Turkey's population, the largest branches of Islam there after the majority Sunni Islam.\n\nSome of the differences that mark Alevis from mainstream Muslims are the use of cemevi halls rather than mosques;  worship ceremonies that feature wine, music and dancing, and where both women and men participate; non-observance of the five daily salat prayers and prostrations (they only bow twice in the presence of their spiritual leader), Ramadan, and the Hajj (considering true pilgrimage to be internal one). Alevis have some links with Twelver Shia Islam (such as importance of the Ahl al-Bayt, the day of Ashura, the Mourning of Muharram, commemorating Karbala),  but do not follow taqlid towards a Marja' \"source of emulation\". Some practices of the Alevis are based on Sufi elements of the Bektashi tariqa.\n\n Christianity \n\nthumb|Church of the Holy Sepulchre\nChristianity originated in the region in the 1st century AD, and was one of the major religions of the region until the Muslim conquests of the mid-to-late 7th century AD. Christianity in the Middle East is characterized by its diverse beliefs and traditions compared to other parts of the old world.\n\nChristian communities have played a vital role in the Middle East. Scholars and intellectuals agree Christians in the Middle East have made significant contributions to Arab and Islamic civilization since the introduction of Islam, and they have had a significant impact contributing the culture of the Mashriq, Turkey, and Iran.\n\nChristians now make up 5% of the population, down from 20% in the early 20th century. The number of Middle Eastern Christians is dropping in some regions in the Middle East due to such factors as extensive emigration. Besides, political turmoil has been and continues to be a major contributor pressing indigenous Near Eastern Christians of various ethnicities towards seeking security and stability outside their homelands.\n\nPresently, the only Christian majority country in the Middle East is Cyprus.\n\n Copts \n\nthumb|Hanging Church\nThe largest Christian group in the Middle East is the originally Coptic-speaking, but now Arabic-speaking Coptic Orthodox Christian population. This Egyptian ethnoreligious community of Copts, is cited by the official census as consisting of 6–11 million people in past decade, \"estimates [for the Coptic Orthodox Church] ranged from 6 to 11 million; 6% (official estimate) to 20% (Church estimate)\" although Coptic sources cite the figure as being closer to 15–20 million. \"In 2008, Pope Shenouda III and Bishop Morkos, bishop of Shubra, declared that the number of Copts in Egypt is more than 12 million\" (Arabic) \"In 2008, father Morkos Aziz the prominent priest in Cairo declared that the number of Copts (inside Egypt) exceeds 16 million.\" Copts reside in mainly Egypt, but also in Sudan and Libya, with tiny communities in Israel, Cyprus and Jordan.\n\nIn Egypt, Copts have relatively higher educational attainment, relatively higher wealth index, and a stronger representation in white collar job types, but limited representation in security agencies. The majority of demographic, socioeconomic and health indicators are similar among Copts and Muslims.Mohamoud YA, Cuadros DF, Abu-Raddad LJ. Characterizing the Copts in Egypt: Demographic, socioeconomic and health indicators, QScience Connect 2013:22 http://dx.doi.org/10.5339/connect.2013.22 Historically; many Copts were accountants, and in 1961 Coptic Christians owned 51% of the Egyptian banks. According to the scholar Andrea Rugh Copts tend to belong to the educated middle and upper-middle class, and according to scholar Lois Farag \"The Copts still played the major role in managing Egypt's state finances. They held 20% of total state capital, 45% of government employment, and 45% of government salarie\".\n\n Maronites \n\nArabic-speaking Maronites count 1.1–1.2 million across the Middle East and most of them are concentrated in Lebanon, with minorities in Syria, Israel and Cyprus. In Lebanon, under the terms of an informal agreement, known as the National Pact, between the various political and religious communities, the president of the country must be a Maronite Christian.United Nations Development Programme: Programme on Governance in the Arab Region : Elections : Lebanon Retrieved 2018-11-18.\n\nAssyrians \nthumb|Rabban Hormizd Monastery\nAssyrians are an Eastern Aramaic speaking people indigenous to Iraq, southeastern Turkey, northwestern Iran and northeastern Syria. They have suffered both ethnic and religious persecution over the last few centuries such as the Assyrian genocide and the Simele massacre, leading to many fleeing to the West or congregating in areas in other parts of the Middle East. In Iraq, numbers of indigenous Assyrians has declined to around 140,000 out of a total population of 46 million.\n\nCurrently, the largest community of Syriac Christians in the Middle East resides in Syria, numbering 877,000–1,139,000. These are a mix of Neo-Aramaic speaking Assyrians and other Arabic-speaking Christian groups, as well as the Arameans of Maaloula and Jubb'adin (original speakers of the almost extinct Western Neo-Aramaic dialect).\n\n Armenians \nIn the Middle Eastern states, there is a sizeable community of Armenians. The Armenians in the Middle East number around 350,000–400,000 and are mostly concentrated in Iran, Lebanon, Cyprus, Syria, Jordan, and Palestine, although well-established communities exist in Iraq, Egypt, Turkey, and other countries of the area. Some other sources claim that the Armenians number around half a million, with their largest community in Iran with 200,000 – 300,000 members. The number of Armenians in Turkey is disputed having a wide range of estimations. More Armenian communities reside in Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and to lesser degree in other Middle Eastern countries such as Iraq and Israel. The Armenian genocide during and after World War I drastically reduced the once sizeable Armenian population.[citation needed]\n\n Other Christian groups \nthumb|Married Eastern Orthodox priest from Jerusalem with his family (three generations), circa 1893\nIn the Persian Gulf states, Bahrain has 1,000 Christian citizens and Kuwait has 400 native Christian citizens, in addition to 450,000 Christian foreign residents in Kuwait. Arab Christians, and those who tend to identify as Arabs, are mostly adherents of the Greek Orthodox Church. In 2010 they numbered 1.1 million in Syria, 350,000 in Lebanon, 250–300,000 in Jordan, 150,000 in Israel and Palestine and smaller numbers in Turkey (18,000) and Iraq. Protestant converts number around 400,000. Melkite Catholics, who are Eastern Catholics of the Greek Rite, comprise almost 600,000. Information sourced from Annuario Pontificio 2017 edition Syrian Orthodox number about 1 million in Syria, Iraq, Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon, with the great majority being in Syria.\n\nThe ethnic Greeks, who had once inhabited large parts of the western Middle East and Asia Minor, have declined since the Arab conquests and recently severely reduced in Turkey, as a result of the Greek genocide and Greco-Turkish War, which followed World War I. Today the biggest Middle Eastern Greek community resides in Cyprus numbering around 793,000 (2008). Cypriot Greeks constitute the only Christian majority state in the Middle East, although Lebanon was founded with a Christian majority in the first half of the 20th century.\n\nSmaller Christian groups include; Georgians, Messianic Jews, Russians and others, such as Kurdish, Turcoman, Iranian, Shabak, Azeri, Circassian and Arab converts exist in small numbers. There are currently several million Christian foreign workers in the Gulf area, mostly from the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka and Indonesia. Middle Eastern Christians are relatively wealthy, well educated, and politically moderate,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/don-belt/pope-to-arab-christians-k_b_203943.html Pope to Arab Christians: Keep the Faith. as they have today an active role in various social, economical, sporting and political aspects in the Middle East.\n\n Judaism \n\nthumb|Western Wall\nFor over 2,000 years of their history, a large portion of Jewish people resided across the Middle East. They are colloquially known as Mizrahi Jews. They include descendants of Babylonian Jews and Mountain Jews from modern Iraq, Morocco, Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, Syria, Bahrain, Kuwait, Iran, Uzbekistan, the Caucasus, Kurdistan, Afghanistan, India, Pakistan, and Yemen. Since the 1950s because of growing anti-semitism, most of these Jews fled to Israel where they make up the majority of Israel's Jewish population and roughly a third of total world Jews. While they no longer live among a Muslim majority, they continue to follow many customs with strong Muslim and Middle Eastern influences making them distinct from European Jews. Today Judaism in the Middle East is mostly practiced in Israel. Israel's population is 75.3% Jewish, with the remainder made up of Muslims (20.6%), Christians, Druze, Baháʼí and various other minorities (4.1%). There are few other countries in the Middle East with significant Jewish populations, but the communities are small and scattered.\n\n Druzism \n\nthumb|The complex hosting the tomb of Nabi Shu'ayb, Israel\nThe Druze faith is one of the major religious groups in the Levant, with between 800,000 and a million adherents. They are primarily located in Lebanon, Syria, and Israel, with smaller communities in Jordan. They make up 5.5% of Lebanon's population, 3% of Syria and 1.6% of Israel. The oldest and most densely populated Druze communities exist in Mount Lebanon and in the south of Syria around Jabal al-Druze (literally the \"Mountain of the Druze\"). Although the Druze faith developed from Isma'ilism, Druze do not identify as Muslims. They maintain Arabic language and culture as integral parts of their identity, with Arabic being their primary language. Developing from Isma'ilite teachings, Druze incorporates Jewish, Christian, Gnostic, Neoplatonic and Iranian elements.\n\nAccording to scholar Colbert C. Held of University of Nebraska, Lincoln the number of Druze people worldwide is around one million, with about 45% to 50% live in Syria, 35% to 40% live in Lebanon, and less than 10% live in Israel, with recently there has been a growing Druze diaspora. Representation ranges from 100,000 in Israel to 700,000 in Syria.\n\n Samaritanism \nSamaritanism is a closely affiliated religion with Judaism, practiced by the ethnoreligious Samaritan community. In the past, the group used to be present in Egypt and Syria as well, but their community had almost collapsed by the late 19th century. Their population mainly reside in the area of  Mount Gerizim, near the city of Nablus. Today the Samaritan community has grown to about 850 persons from as few as 150 in the early 20th century.\n\nSamaritanism has a shared history and many shared customs with Judaism, and the main difference is the position of Mount Gerizim in their belief system. In their views not Jerusalem, but Mount Gerizim is regarded as the utmost sacred place chosen by God, where Joshua's alter was and where stones of Law emerged. Additionally, because of the many similarities, debates emerged regarding the question of Samaritanism being a Jewish sect or an independent religion.Reinhard Pummer, \"Samaritanism – A Jewish Sect or an Independent Form of Yahwism?\" in Samaritans: Past and Present edited by Menachem Mor and Friedrich V.

(Director). (2018). Samaritan. [Video/DVD] Beliane. Retrieved from https://video.alexanderstreet.com/watch/Samaritan Their holy script is called the Samaritan Pentateuch, that is believed to be the unaltered version of the Jewish script, the Torah.\n\n Baháʼí Faith \n\nThe Baháʼí Faith is a relatively new religion teaching the essential worth of all religions and the unity of all people. Established by Baháʼu'lláh in the 19th century, it initially developed in Iran and parts of the Middle East, where it has faced ongoing persecution since its inception.\n\nAccording to the Baháʼí teachings, religion is revealed in an orderly and progressive way by a single God through Manifestations of God, who are the founders of major world religions throughout history; Buddha, Jesus, and Muhammad are noted as the most recent of these before the Báb and Baháʼu'lláh. Baháʼís regard the major religions as fundamentally unified in purpose, though varied in social practices and interpretations. The Baháʼí Faith stresses the unity of all people, explicitly rejecting racism, sexism and nationalism. At the heart of Baháʼí teachings is the goal of a unified world order that ensures the prosperity of all nations, races, creeds, and classes.\n\nThe Baháʼí Faith has noteworthy representation in Iran, Yemen, United Arab Emirates, Palestine, Israel, and Turkey. Its international headquarters are located on the northern slope of Mount Carmel at Haifa, Israel. Founded in Iran in 1863, the Baháʼí Faith has an estimated 7 to 8 million followers across the world.\n\nNon-Abrahamic monotheistic faiths \n\n Zoroastrianism \n\nIn the Middle East, Zoroastrianism is found in central Iran. Today, there are estimated to be under 20,000 Zoroastrians in Iran. It is one of the oldest monotheistic religions as it was founded 3500 years ago.  It was also one of the most powerful religions in the world for about 1000 years, during the Persian pre-Islamic dynasties. Now, however, it is considered one of the smallest religions with only 190,000 followers worldwide. There is a supreme deity called Ahura Mazda; lord of wisdom, symbolised as light of sun and fire. There is a dualistic principal of Spenta Mainyu; creative mind or goodness and Angra Mainyu; destructive mind or evil, this is known in Middle Persian as Ahriman. It is ultimately up to the individual to decide which the two paths they choose to follow. Zoroastrians follow the Avesta which is their primary sacred text.\n\n Mandaeism \n\nMandaeism, sometimes also known as Sabianism (after the mysterious Sabians mentioned in the Quran, a name historically claimed by several religious groups),  p. 5. is a Gnostic and monotheistic religion. There are between 60,000 and 70,000 Mandaeans worldwide and in the Middle East, they are found in Iraq and Iran. They revere Adam, Abel, Seth, Enos, Noah, Shem, Aram, and especially John the Baptist. Mandaeans are a closed ethnoreligious group.\n\n Yazidism \n\nYazidis (Yezidi, Ezidi or Ezdi) are an ethno religious group in Iraq, Syria and Turkey, in more recent times, they've also established communities in Russia, Georgia and Armenia after fleeing persecution from the Sunnis during Ottoman era. They follow a monotheistic ethnic religion that has roots in a western branch of an Iranic pre-Zoroastrian religion. Their religion is based on the belief of one God who created the world and entrusted it into the care of seven Holy Beings. The leader of these Angels is Tawûsê Melek, who is symbolized with a peacock. Published estimates of the Yazidi population vary greatly; from 300,000 worldwide to 700,000 in Northern Iraq alone, according to a recent estimate by U.S State Department, 500,000-700,000 Yazidis reside in Iraq today. Yazidis of Iraq live in Sinjar Mountains, districts of Shekhan, Zakho and Simele in Duhok, and Tel Kaif district and Bashiqa in Nineveh governorate.\n\n Bábism \n\nBabism or the Bab Faith originated in Iran in the middle of the 19th century. The religion developed in the context of Shia Islam, where a merchant declared himself to be the prophesied 12th imam, and took the title of Bab However throughout his ministry his titles and claims underwent much evolution as the Báb progressively outlined his teachings. The Bab's claims led to public unrest and ultimately the execution of the Bab by the Iranian government.\n\nThe Bábí movement signaled a break with Shia Islam, beginning a new religious system with its own unique laws, teachings, and practices. Babism is a monotheistic religion which professes that there is one incorporeal, unknown, and incomprehensible God who manifests his will in an unending series of theophanies, called Manifestation of God.\n\nWhile Bábism was violently opposed by both clerical and government establishments, it led to the founding of the Baháʼí Faith, whose followers consider the religion founded by the Báb as a predecessor to their own.\n\nAccording to one scholar there are currently no more than a few thousand adherents of the Babi Faith.\n\n Ishikism \n\n Sikhism \n\nSikhism, a monotheistic Indian religion, developed from the spiritual teachings of Guru Nanak (1469–1539), the faith's first guru, and the nine Sikh gurus who succeeded him. The tenth guru, Gobind Singh (1666–1708), named the Sikh scripture Guru Granth Sahib as his successor, bringing to a close the line of human gurus and establishing the scripture as the 11th and last eternally living guru, a religious spiritual/life guide for Sikhs.\n\nThe core beliefs of Sikhism, articulated in the Guru Granth Sahib, include faith and meditation in the name of the one creator; divine unity and equality of all humankind; engaging in seva ('selfless service'); striving for justice for the benefit and prosperity of all; and honest conduct and livelihood while living a householder's life. Following this standard, Sikhism rejects claims that any particular religious tradition has a monopoly on Absolute Truth.\n\nSikhism, the fifth-largest organized religion in the world after Islam, Christianity, Hinduism, and Buddhism, having over 25 million Sikhs worldwide, has a small presence in the Middle East too, mainly in the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Bahrain, Kuwait, and Iran. Most of them are Punjabi-speaking Indian expatriates.\n\nOther religions\nHinduism\n\nA form of ancient Vedic Hinduism was present in ancient Persia before Zoroastrianism became the dominant religion.\n\nMillions of members of the Indian diaspora, of different religions, reside and work in Arab states of the Persian Gulf. Many of them are Hindu. Many came due to the migration of Indians and Nepalese expatriates and employees to the oil-rich states around the Persian Gulf.\n\nHindu temples have been built in Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Yemen, and Oman.\n\nBuddhism\n\nIt is estimated that in the Middle East around 900,000 people, perhaps more, profess Buddhism as their religion. Buddhist adherents make up just over 0.3% of the total population of the Middle East.\n\nAlthough Buddhism has had a presence in the Middle East for over 1000 years, it has recently experienced a revival with an estimated 900,000 people (perhaps more) who profess Buddhism as their religion. Buddhist adherents make up just over 0.3% of the total population of the Middle East. Many of these Buddhists are workers who have migrated from other parts of Asia to the Middle East in the last 20 years, many from countries and regions that have large Buddhist populations, such as China, Vietnam, Japan, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Bhutan. A small number of engineers, company directors, and managers from Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, and South Korea have also moved to the Middle East.\n\nIrreligion\n\nAccording to a 2012 WIN-Gallup International 'Religiosity and Atheism Index', atheists are a small minority in the Middle East with only 2% of those surveyed in the Arab world identifying themselves as \"committed atheists\". Dar al-Ifta al-Misriyyah, the branch of the Egyptian government that issues fatawa (religious edicts), gives lower (if less reliable) numbers, stating that there are 866 atheists in Egypt – \"roughly 0.001% of the population\"—325 in Morocco, and 32 in Yemen (defined as not only unbelievers, but secularists and \"Muslims who convert to other religions\").\n\nSome countries (Iraq, Tunisia) surveyed had 0% of respondents identifying as atheists. Other countries indicated low percentages (Palestine 1% and Turkey 2%). a lower percentage compared to other places like in Europe, Africa, Latin America, or South Asia.\n\nAccording to unbelievers in the Arab world, their numbers are growing but they suffer from persecution.\nAuthor and historian Faisal Devji notes that although Saudi Arabia punishes unbelief with death, 5% of those surveyed identified themselves as atheists. Devji states there is \"a new movement of atheists in countries such as Saudi Arabia ... which takes the form of secret societies\",  meeting \"in internet chat rooms and unnamed physical locations, like the mystics of old\".\n\nIn Egypt, Al Jazeera reported a clandestine atheist group of over 100 in Alexandria in 2013. The group complained of mistreatment of atheists by society and government. A Pew survey found 63% of Egyptian Muslims favored the death penalty for those who leave the religion of Islam. The Egyptian penal code punishes \"contempt of heavenly religions\", and as of 2013 Egyptians had been arrested and/or imprisoned for activities such as setting up a Facebook page calling for atheism, writing a book entitled Where is God?, and \"defamation of religion\".\n\nCountries\nEgypt\nReligion in Egypt consists of Islam (mostly Sunni Muslim) 80–90%, Coptic Christians 10–20% and other Christians 1%. As Egypt has modernized with new forms of media and the Egyptian press was liberalized in the 2000s, Coptic Christianity has become a main topic of religious controversy. There is a degree of tension between the Muslims and Copts of Egypt as Copts argue for more representation in government and less legal and administrative discrimination. With this greater freedom of press, the Coptic issue has just begun to break into public awareness, but also due to a minority within both religious communities having extremist views, the media may also be exacerbating the sectarian tension by only publicizing examples of prejudice.\n\nAnother current religious tension in Egypt is the role of the Muslim Brotherhood, founded by Hassan al-Banna in Egypt. Many countries have now developed their branches. Many are violent and most Arab governments actively try to restrain the group by arresting and killing members. Currently, as the new government of Egypt is trying to establish itself, many are concerned that a member of the Muslim Brotherhood will again step in and claim leadership. For the current candidates for the presidency, more than one is likely to be affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nThe Brotherhood is however unpopular among the majority of Egyptians on account of its fundamentalist views, its clampdown on tourism and its desire to impose Sharia law on the nation.\n\nIran\nReligion in Iran is made up of 98% Islam (Shi'a 89%, Sunni 9%) and 2% Zoroastrian, Jewish, Christian, and Baháʼí. There was much religious oppression and executions of members of the Baháʼí Faith. Religious minorities are now beginning to hold a larger presence and significance in Iran and are being acknowledged as such.\n\nThe Islamic Revolution replaced an old-world monarchy with a theocracy based on the Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist (Velayat-e Faqih) where a Shia cleric (faqih) is the ruler, though there are also competitive elections of candidates approved by another clerical body. This is a mix of republicanism and religion where that would use religion to rule for elective and democratic institutions; it was to be a blend of liberalism and religious injunctions (abs). Islam would be protected under this Islamic Republic and unelected positions like the Supreme Leader and the Guardian Council would have unlimited power over the nation. With the nuclear program developing in Iran and much conflict after September 11, 2001, Iran and the Islamic Republic are at a crossroads.\n\nIraq\nReligion in Iraq is represented by 97% Islam (Shiite 60%–65%, Sunni 32%–37%), and 3% Christian or other. Because of this large majority of Shia over Sunni Muslim, there is much tension between the two groups.\n\nIsrael\n\nReligion in Israel is represented by the following religious make-up: Judaism 77%, Islam 16%, Christian 2%, Druze 2% (2003). As of 2013, the Israeli \"Government - Christians Forum\" was formed under the umbrella of the Ministry of Public Security, by Dr. Mordehcai Zaken, head of the Minorities Affairs Desk, to address and promote the concerns of Christian leaders and representative in their interactions with the State. Israel represents the religious Holy Land for Jews, Christians, Muslims, and Baha'is. All religions are present in Israel and lay personal claim to the land. Due to the significant Israeli/Palestinian conflict, tensions are high in the religious community. The majority of displaced and Palestinians are Muslim and the majority of current Israeli citizens are Jewish so establishing the state borders is highly influenced by religion.\n\nOne of the main difficulties in establishing peace between the two countries is because of Jerusalem. Each of the three main religions is incredibly attached to this city and claim it as their own. Therefore, it is difficult to determine whether Palestine or Israel will encompass this region. Maps produced within the territories represent Jerusalem differently. Palestinian maps draw Jerusalem as divided and Israeli maps show it as a part of Israeli territory.\n\nJordan\nReligion in Jordan is represented by 92% Muslim (Sunni), 6% Christian (mostly Greek Orthodox), and 2% other.\n\nLebanon\nthumb|150px|Saint George Maronite Cathedral and the Mohammad Al-Amin Mosque, Beirut. 41% in Lebanon is Christians representing the mosaic of the Middle East, and contributing heavily in the Media, Politics, Entertainment, Banking... sectors in Lebanon and the World.\n\nReligion in Lebanon is the most unique in the Middle East, and a mix of religions make up Lebanon, represented by 54% Muslim (Shi'a, Sunni, Isma'ilite, Alawite/Nusayri), 41% Christian (Maronite, Greek Orthodox, Melkite, and Christian churches non-native to Lebanon like Armenian Apostolic Church, Armenian Catholic Church, Chaldean Catholic Church, Roman Catholic Church, Assyrian Church of the East, Armenian Evangelical Church, Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, Protestant), while the rest 5% of Lebanon belongs to the Druze faith. Lebanon has a confessional political system in which, regardless of political parties, the President is always Maronite Christian, the Prime Minister a Sunni Muslim, and the Speaker of the Parliament a Shi'ite Muslim, and the Deputy Prime Minister Greek Orthodox Christian. Also, the Army General has to be Christian and the Bank Governor has to be always Christian as well. In addition, 50% of the Parliament is represented by Christian Members, according to the law in Lebanon since the end of the war until today. This is the foundation of uniqueness of Lebanon and the source of much of its conflicts; and while changes have been made to attempt to make parliamentary representation more even, many are still urging for reform and change. Some would like the confessionalist government to be abolished.\n\nSaudi Arabia\nReligion in Saudi Arabia  is allegedly 100% Muslim. It is illegal to practice any other religion than Islam in Saudi Arabia. There is still tension, however, between the Sunnis and the Shias. Shiite Islamist revolution has never been a huge threat to the Saudi Arabian government, though, because it is such a small population. Sunni Islamists, though, present a larger threat to the government because of their large Saudi Arabian population. These Sunni groups often dissent through violence targeted at government, Western or non-Muslims that threat the Muslim nation, Shiites, and sometimes generally directed against moral corruption.\n\nSyria\nReligion in Syria is represented by 70% Islam (Sunni), 12% Alawite, 5% Druze, and other Islamic sects, 10% Christian (various sects), and there is some Jewish representation (tiny communities in Damascus, Al Qamishli, and Aleppo).\n\nTurkey\nReligion in Turkey is represented by 92% Muslim (with 88% Sunni and 4% Alevi), with 6% having no religion. Originally a militarily secularized government, under the president Erdogan, religious freedom for Muslims has become much more accessible in Turkey. There has been a growing religious resurgence in Turkey and more and more citizens find significance in their religious identities. The previous laws disallowing the Hijab, religious headscarf, in schools and public places has been a huge source of contention. Now, it is a matter of civil rights in courts. The case of Sahin 2004 was one that exemplified the tension between religious secularism, civil rights and the government's power in Turkey. The case revolved around a student at university being allowed to wear the Hijab in class. Religious education is also a topic of debate in Turkey. Before 1980, private religious education was banned and then it was changed to be required. As it is currently being reevaluated, the question is whether religious education should be banned again, optional or if it should be obligatory and plural.\n\nYemen\nReligion in Yemen is represented by a majority of Islam (including Sunni and Shiite), small numbers of native Jewish communities, Baháʼí, Christian, and Hindu. Followers of the Zaydi Islamic jurisprudence are called Zaydi Shi'a and make up about 35% of Muslims in Yemen.",

The city of Barrie plans to make it possible to walk the original route of the trail, but at present no public right-of-way exists. Very small portions of the original portage are incorporated into the Nine MIle Portage Heritage Trail which is a multi-use recreational trail running between Meridian Place in downtown Barrie and Fort Willow in Springwater Township. Most of the original portage route is on private property and not accessible to the public.https://www.barrie.ca/sites/default/files/2022-07/NineMilePortage_Route_Map.pdf\n\nHistory\nIn the early centuries of the colonial period, the Nine Mile Portage was a minor fur trade route. It was used by Étienne Brûlé and Alexander Henry, among others.\n\nJohn Franklin 'fix[ed] the longitude and latitude of the “Nottawassaga Portage” at 44º22’55\"N and 79º53’41\"W' during his second overland expedition to the Arctic Ocean.\n\nFollowing the War of 1812, the portage was used by the Royal Navy and British Army until as late as the 1850s to transport supplies to the Penetanguishene Naval Yard.",

After almost 30 years of operation, the facility officially closed later that same year.\n\nThe site was acquired and developed by the Trammell Crow Company for an undisclosed sum. Construction began in the beginning of 1988. Many structures of the industrial complex were demolished in favor of parking spaces as well as a 500,000 square foot parking garage.\n\nOne of the first anchor stores to open in the first phase of Village Crossing was a 65,000 square foot Jewel-Osco building and a 112,000 square foot Montgomery Ward store (which closed in 1999).\n\nIn 2001, Crown Theaters Village Crossing 18 opened.

    "clean_text": "Edward Charles Pierce (3 January 1930 – 4 July 2002) was a politician and physician from the U.S. state of Michigan.\n\nLife and career\nPierce was born in the town of Three Rivers, in St. Joseph County, Michigan. He moved with his family to Ann Arbor, Michigan, in 1940 at the age of ten and, after serving in the U.S. Air Force, studied at the University of Michigan, from which he earned a B.A. degree in 1955 and an M.D. degree in 1959.\n\nPierce served a two-year term on the Ann Arbor city council from 1964 to 1966. In spring 1967, Pierce made his first bid for the mayoralty of Ann Arbor, winning the Democratic nomination but losing the general election to incumbent Republican mayor Wendell E. Hulcher. In the late 1960s, Pierce also took part in activism against the Vietnam War. (and led the opposition to the Fermi 2 nuclear reactor)\n\nPierce ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. House of Representatives from Michigan's second district in 1974 and 1976, losing in the Democratic primary on his first attempt, and in the general election on his second attempt to Republican Carl Pursell. He was elected to the Michigan State Senate from the state's eighteenth district in 1978, and held the seat through 1982. In the State Senate, Pierce served as chairman of the Health and Social Services Committee and as vice chairman of the Senate Administration and Rules Committee and the Education Committee.\n\nIn 1985, Pierce again ran for Ann Arbor mayor. He won the Democratic nomination by defeating University of Michigan professor Bunyan Bryant, a liberal activist who was bidding to become the city's second African-American mayor, and he subsequently beat out Republican candidate Richard A. Hadler in the general election. Pierce served one two-year term as mayor, from 1985 to 1987, but was defeated in the April 1987 mayoral election by Republican city councilman Gerald D. Jernigan.\n\nIn his medical career, Pierce ran an Ann Arbor family practice until his 1996 retirement, served at St. Joseph Mercy Hospital (Michigan) as chair of the Family Practice Department, and established a free medical clinic, the Summit Medical Center, which lasted from 1968 to 1978 and was intended to provide care regardless of patients' ability to pay. In 1996, Pierce co-founded the group Merian's Friends, which promoted the legalization of physician aid in dying for terminally ill patients, and served as its volunteer chairman. The group vigorously campaigned for a 1997 Michigan ballot initiative to legalize the practice, but voters rejected the measure by a considerable margin.\n\nPierce died in Ann Arbor in 2002 and is survived by three daughters, Lynne, Amy and Jan,  and one son, Paul.  Lynne Pierce, a lawyer in Wayne County, Michigan, was elected to the Third Judicial Circuit Court of Michigan in 2008.  Jan Pierce White founded the Boys & Girls Club of Rohnert Park, California in 1991. She is a guest teacher for Sonoma County schools as well as a singer/songwriter and judge for West Coast Songwriters.  When last heard from Amy and Paul both lived in Florida.",

    "title": "Himal and Nagaray",
    "clean_text": "Princess Himal and Nagaray or Himal and Nagrai is a very popular Kashmiri folktale about the love between a human princess and a Naga (snake-like) prince. The story is well-known in the region and has many renditions. One version of the story was collected by British reverend James Hinton Knowles and published in his book Folk-Tales of Kashmir.Knowles, James Hinton. Folk-tales of Kashmir. London: Trübner. 1888. pp. 491–504.\n\nSource \nRev. Knowles attributed the source of his version to a man named Pandit Shiva Rám of Banáh Mahal Srínagar.\n\nPublication \nThe tale was also republished as Himal and Nagrai, Himal and Nagraya, Heemal Nagrai, and as Heemal and Nagirai.\n\nSummary\nIn Knowles's version, titled Nágray and Himál, a poor brahmin named Soda Ram, who has an \"ill-tempered\" wife, laments his luck. One day, he decides to go on a pilgrimage to Hindustan, since a local king gives five lachs of rupees to the poor. On his journey, he stops to rest for a while and a serpent comes from a spring nearby and enters his bag. He sees the animal and plans to spring a trap for his wife so that the snake will bite her. He returns home with the bag and gives it to his wife. The woman opens the bag as the serpent spring out of it and turns into a human boy. The couple raises the boy, named Nágray, and become rich.\n\nThe boy shows incredible wisdom for his young age. One day, he asks his father where he can find \"a pure spring\" that he can bathe in, and Soda Rám points to a pool at princess Himal's garden, heavily guarded by the king's troops. He says he will find a way: he approaches an opening in the wall, changes into a serpent to crawl through and returns to human form. The princess hears some noise coming from the direction of the pool and questions for the strange presence. Nágray turns back into a snake and slithers away. He returns to the pool twice, and on the third time princess Himal notices his beauty, and falls in love with him. Himal sends a maid to follow the snake and sees it enter Soda Ram's house.\n\nPrincess Himal tells her father she will marry no other than the son of brahman Soda Ram. Soda Ram is called to the king's presence to deal with the wedding arrangements. The king suggests his prospective son-in-law should come in a regal and magnificent wedding procession. Nágray instructs his adoptive father to toss a paper in a certain spring, one hour before the wedding, and the procession will come. Himal and Nágray marry and live in a palace built near a river.\n\nHowever, Nágray's other wives, which live in the realm of snakes, decide to pay a visit to the human princess, under a magical disguise, due to their lordship's extended absence. One of them uses a disguise of a glass seller to sell her wares to the palace. Nágray finds the utensils and destroys each of them, forbidding his human wife to buy any other. The second snake wife dons the guise of a sweeper. She tells Himal her husband was Nágray, also a sweeper (a man of a lower caste). The false sweeper gives Himal instructions on how to prove his origins: throw him in a spring and, if he sinks, he is not a sweeper.\n\nHimal tells Nágray of the encounter and he admonishes her. But she insists he proves his caste. He enters the spring and slowly sinks in, until he disappears. Himal, then, is left alone and without a husband.  She returns to her palatial home, mounts a caravanserai and begins to give alms to the poor. On one occasion, a poor man and his daughter pay her a visit and tell that, in a jungle, they came across a spring. From this spring, an army marched out and set out a dinner for their king. Soon after, the army returned to the spring and this king gave them some alms, \"in the name of foolish Himal\".\n\nWith renewed hope, princess Himal asks the man to guide her to this location. They rest for the night, as Himal, still awake, sees Nágray coming from the spring. She begs him to return to their wedded life together, but Nágray warns of the danger of his snake wives. He turns her into a pebble and takes her to the watery kingdom. The snake wives notice the object and tell their husband to turn it back to human shape.\n\nThe snake wives decide to set Himal as their housekeeper. They tell her she must boil the milk for their serpentine children, and to knock the pots down. However, Himal knocks down the pots while the milk is still boiling hot, and, as the serpent children drink the milk, they die. Their serpentine mothers, overwhelmed with grief, turn into serpents and bite Himal. A grieving Nágray places her corpse on top of tree, alternating visits between her resting place and the spring.\n\nOne day, a holy man climbs up the tree and sees the corpse of Himal, still beautiful as she was in life. He prays to Náráyan and she returns to life. The holy man takes her to his home. Nágray, noticing its disappearance, begins a search and finds her at the holy man's house. While she was sleeping, Nágray enters the bedroom in his serpentine form and coils around her bedpost. The holy man's son, unaware of the serpent's nature, takes a knife and cuts the serpent into two pieces. Himal awakes startled and sees the serpent's corpse, lamenting her husband's death.\n\nNágray's corpse is burned, and Himal throws herself into the funeral pyre to die with him. However, deities Shiva and Parvati reunite both lovers by resurrecting their ashes in a magical spring. Accessed 17 Dec. 2024.\n\nWritten history \nThe story of Himal and Nagaray is considered to be a \"well-known tale\", representative of the Kashmiri region.\n\nIndian scholarship states that the tale has existed in the oral repertoire of the Kashmir region, Accessed 17 Dec. 2024. with multiple renditions appearing in both Persian and Kashmiri in the 18th and 19th centuries.Zutshi, Chitralekha. Oxford India Short Introductions Series: Kashmir. Oxford University Press, 2019. pp. 43-44. .Dhar, Somnath. Jammu and Kashmir (India, the land and the people). India: National Book Trust, 1999. p. 119. .Zutshi, Chitralekha. Kashmir’s Contested Pasts: Narratives, Geographies, and the Historical Imagination. Oxford University Press. 2014. pp. 279-284. . According to S. L. Sadhu, the earliest recorded version of the story was by Maulvi Sadr-ud-Din in Persian with the title Qasai Heemal va Arzun.\n\nLocal Kashmiri poet Waliullah Mattu (or Wali Ullah Mot) translated the story as a masnavi in the Kashmiri language.Encyclopaedia Of Art And Culture In India. Vol. 7: Jammu and Kashmir. Delhi: Isha Books, 2003. p. 128. In Mot's version of the mathnavi Himal Negyray, Himal is Balavir's daughter and comes from Balapore/Balapur, while snake-prince Negyray from Talpatal (the netherworld). After being adopted by a human Pandit, Negyray marries a serpent-princess, then meets and marries human lady Himal. His disappearance is caused when Himal forces him to take a dip in a bowl of milk, which transports him back to Talpatal. At the end of the story, Himal plunges herself into Negyray's funeral pyre.\n\nKnowles also informed that another version existed with the title Hímál Nágárajan, obtained from Pandit Hargopal Kol. He also noted that, in another version, Himal is a Hindu devotee, and falls in love with Nágray, an Islamic man.Knowles, James Hinton. Folk-tales of Kashmir. London: Trübner. 1888. p. 504 (footnote nr. 10).\n\nAnalysis \nName of the heroes\nIndian scholar Suniti Kumar Chatterji proposed that Nagaray derives from the Sanskrit Nāga-rāja, meaning 'king of nagas' (a nāga is a mythical snake of Indian religion). As for the character of the princess, he considered that her name means \"Jasmine-garland\", corresponding to Sanskrit Yūthī-mālā and Prakrit Yūhīmāla.\n\nAccording to professor Ruth Laila Schmidt, the hero's name, Nágráy (Nāgarājā 'snake king'), indicates remnants of snake worship in the Western Himalayas (including the Kashmir region), that is, worship of the nagas, snake-like beings of Hindu mythology associated with water. Also, the Kashmiri word for water spring is nāg, another link between water bodies and nagas as water-spirits.\n\nParallels\nSuniti Kumar Chatterji also noticed some resemblance between the Kashmiri tale and the Lithuanian folktale Eglė the Queen of Serpents, wherein a human maiden named Egle marries Zilvinas, a snake-like prince that lives in an underwater palace.\n\nRelation to other folktales\nThe tale has been compared to folktales of type ATU 425, \"The Search for the Lost Husband\", of the international classification of folktales.Bamford, Karen. \"Quest for the Vanished Husband/Lover, Motifs H1385.4 and H1385.5\". In: Jane Garry and Hasan El-Shamy (eds.). Archetypes and Motifs in Folklore and Literature. A Handbook. Armonk / London: M.E. Sharpe, 2005. p. 254. In Stith Thompson and Warren Roberts's Types of Indic Oral Tales, the tale is classified under its own Indic type, 425D Ind, \"Search for Serpent Husband\".Thompson, Stith; Roberts, Warren Everett. Types of Indic Oral Tales: India, Pakistan, and Ceylon. Academia Scientiarum Fennica, 1960. p. 63 (entry \"Knowles\").Blackburn, Stuart. \"Coming Out of His Shell: Animal-Husband Tales in India\". In: Syllables of Sky: Studies in South Indian Civilization. Oxford University Press, 1995. p. 45. .\n\nLegacy\nThe tale was also adapted into an opera by Kashmiri poet Dinanath Nadim.",

Following the accident, three of the four lines (the Up [Southbound] and Down [Northbound] Fast lines and the Down Slow line) were blocked by the wreckage of the collision. The Up Slow line was not damaged and was used by special trains to take the dead and injured to Newcastle upon Tyne. The line was also used later that day for both Up and Down trains to clear other trains stranded in the area by the blockage  but was later used only for Up trains, Down trains being diverted via Harrogate over the Harrogate-Northallerton line which, though it had been closed, was re-opened for the purpose. Special bus services were introduced between Leeds and Northallerton and between York and Thirsk to replace local train services disrupted by the accident. Breakdown cranes were ordered from York, Leeds and Gateshead (Newcastle), and the derailed vehicles were cleared from the track by 23:30 on 1 August. Repairs to the track were speedy and the three damaged lines were all open by 16:20 on 2 August, all with an initial speed limit of .\n\nAn extract from The Ministry of Transport report into the accident states:\n\nThe 45mph limit for the 26 Cemflo wagons in the freight train was lower than the designed limit of 60mph following derailments with this type of wagon, and this was the speed at the time of derailment. After the derailment and separation of his train, the freight train driver ran back to use a telephone on a signal post about 100 yards (90 m) behind his locomotive. He had no time to speak to the signalman before, to his horror, he first heard and then saw 1A26 loom into view and despite heavy braking, strike the fouling wagon. The buffer beam, draw-gear and coupling shackle of this wagon were ripped clean off by the force of the impact and thrown  into an adjacent field.\n\nAs 1A26 had approached signal D19, the driver was not accelerating as hard as he normally would have been because he was uneasy about the view ahead—he should have been able to see the next signal but it was obscured by a cloud of smoke or dust and he had instinctively backed off the throttle. As he passed D19 he became aware of the cement wagon across his path about 400 yards (365 m) ahead. He made an emergency application of the train vacuum brake and the locomotive air brake. He operated the sanding gear to increase the grip on the rails and shut down the engine of his locomotive to reduce the risk of fire in case the derailed tank wagon contained flammable liquid as he realised he now had no chance to avoid the collision. As he approached the obstruction he became aware of the freight train guard running back towards him waving a red flag.\n\nOn impact the locomotive of 1A26 DP2 lurched to the right and the left hand side of the cab was severely damaged along with the left hand side of the first three coaches, all side-corridor BR Mark 1s. On coaches 2 and 3 this was fortunately on the corridor side, but on the leading coach this was the compartment side and this is where most of the casualties were.\n\nThe Thirsk signalman averted further disaster by throwing all his signals to danger and sending an \"obstruction danger\" bell code to the Northallerton and Pilmoor boxes either side, stopping a London-bound express at Thirsk station less than  to the north. 1A26 had come to rest fouling the Up Fast line and this express would have struck the wreckage only a few minutes later. Also at the time an RAF aircraft flying over saw the crash scene and immediately called for help to be sent.\n\nAftermath\nLocomotive DP2 was damaged beyond repair and finally broken up for spares in 1970. \n\nLocomotive D283, the English Electric type 4 diesel hauling the goods train was undamaged.\n\nCause and prevention\nThe wagon derailment was blamed on excessive wear in the suspension components, thought to be caused by cement dust abrasion, in combination with slight variations in both wheel-set diameter and track alignment. This resulted in a typical \"waddling\", lateral oscillation of \"CemFlo\" tank wagons. Furthermore, it was a number of other accidents involving suspected poor riding of CemFlo wagons that resulted in progressively more severe speed restrictions being placed on any trains containing this type. At the Thirsk crash, the oscillation built up to such a state that it eventually threw the rear wheel-set of one wagon off the rails, even though the train was travelling below the maximum  permitted for four-wheeled wagons. Indeed, the pronounced waddling of this very train was noted by the signalman at Pilmoor in his log as he recorded its passing about 6 minutes before the derailment. Also at Pilmoor, two men were watching the trains pass. One of them had noted that the leading wheel-set of a wagon \"somewhere just forward of the halfway point\" had dropped heavily into the gap on a cross-over then rebounded higher than the rest. At the time, although he noted it, he thought little of it, but on hearing of the accident he felt compelled to bring this to the attention of the authorities.\n\nFollowing the accident, wagon LA201 was selected for rolling-road tests at Doncaster having been judged to be in an almost identical condition to LA223 – the first vehicle to derail in the crash. As speed increased, flange-to-flange hunting (moving from side to side) was noted to set in under both laden and unladen conditions. Critical speed was noted as between .\n\nFollowing the accident, British Rail imposed a maximum speed of  for loaded CemFlo Wagons and  unloaded.",

    "title": "Extreme Championship Wrestling",
    "clean_text": "Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) was an American professional wrestling promotion that was based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and operated by its parent company HHG Corporation. The promotion was founded in 1992 by Tod Gordon as National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) affiliate Eastern Championship Wrestling.  The following year, businessman and wrestling manager Paul Heyman took over the creative end of the promotion from Eddie Gilbert. Under Heyman, the promotion was rechristened as Extreme Championship Wrestling.\n\nThe promotion was known for highlighting a \"hardcore wrestling\" style, with matches regularly featuring weapons (including the frequent use of chairs, tables, and fire) and revolving around adult-themed storylines.  Though the hardcore style was the main focus, ECW also showcased various international styles of professional wrestling not usually seen in the U.S., ranging from Mexican lucha libre to Japanese puroresu.\n\nHeyman's creative direction created new stars, and established ECW as the third major national wrestling promotion in the United States in the second half of the 1990s, competing with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) and World Championship Wrestling (WCW). HHG folded ECW in 2001 when it was unable to secure a new national television contract, and World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. purchased the assets of the company from bankruptcy in January 2003. The company would nominally remain active until 2007.\n\nFollowing the success of the One Night Stand tribute show in 2005, WWE relaunched the ECW franchise as a third brand in 2006 alongside their existing Raw and SmackDown brands. It debuted on June 13, 2006, on Sci Fi in the United States and ran for close to four years until it aired its final episode on February 16, 2010, on the rebranded Syfy.\n\nStyle and presentation\n\nthumb|left|ECW became known for its hardcore style, frequently incorporating weapons into matches. Sabu (putting Rhino through a table in this picture) especially was connected with this practice.\nFollowing the lead of the World Wrestling Federation, the majority of American professional wrestling promotions in the 1980s and early 1990s orientated their style and presentation towards catering to mainstream audiences, families and casual fans. However, under the creative direction of Paul Heyman, ECW rebranded itself as \"Extreme Championship Wrestling\" in 1994 and orientated its entire style and presentation towards a gritty, counter-cultural, underground-style presentation directly inspired by the emerging cultural forces of grunge music, hip-hop and extreme sports. In contrast to clean-cut wrestling shows centred around \"superhero\" archetypes, ECW pioneered the use of adult-orientated shows featuring high levels of violence, vulgarity, and sexuality centred around anti-hero characters to develop a niche separate to that of its peers. ECW further accentuated the ruckus atmosphere of its shows through the use of contemporary chart music instead of using stock music; the performers in ECW would make their entrances accompanied by the music of artists such as Metallica, Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam,  Dr. Dre and Ice Cube.\n\nAlthough the concept of \"hardcore wrestling\" (a style of professional wrestling associated with the use of objects as weapons) did not originate with ECW, they were widely credited with popularizing the style in the United States and were intimately associated with it. Although hardcore wrestling became the calling card of the promotion, ECW has also been credited with helping to introduce other professional wrestling styles such as lucha libre and puroresu to the American audience.\n\nHistory\n1989 to 1994: Origins, founding, and NWA membership\nthumb|200px|left|Eastern Championship Wrestling logo.\nBased in the working-class city of Philadelphia, ECW had its origins in 1989 under the banner Tri-State Wrestling Alliance (TWA) owned by Joel Goodhart. In 1992, Goodhart sold his share of the company to his partner, Tod Gordon, who created his own promotion from TWA's remnants, Eastern Championship Wrestling (ECW). When Eastern Championship Wrestling was founded, it was not a member of the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA), though it joined the alliance on September 3 1993 at the behest of its lead booker \"Hot Stuff\" Eddie Gilbert. Gilbert, through his position as lead booker of ECW, managed to secure television time on SportsChannel Philadelphia starting in April 1993. Gilbert, after a falling out with Tod Gordon, was replaced in September 1993 by then-28-year-old businessman Paul Heyman. Heyman, known in professional wrestling as Paul E. Dangerously, had just been fired by World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and was looking for a new challenge.\n\nHeyman's creative influence had an immediate impact on ECW, and throughout 1993 and into 1994 the terms \"Hardcore\" and \"Extreme\" were increasingly used to characterize both the in-ring style and the general presentation of the promotion. Instead of relying on former WWF stars such as Jimmy Snuka, Heyman pivoted the promotion to centering around local up-and-coming talents such as Shane Douglas, Sabu, The Sandman and Tommy Dreamer.\n\n1994: Secession from the NWA\n\nthumb|300px|Shane Douglas threw down the NWA World Heavyweight Championship in favor of the ECW World Heavyweight Championship in 1994\nBy 1994 ECW was proving to be the strongest member of what remained of the National Wrestling Alliance. It was therefore decided by consensus between ECW and the rest of the NWA that ECW's main star, Shane Douglas, would win a tournament to win the vacant NWA Worlds Heavyweight Championship. However, unbeknownst to the NWA, ECW operators Tod Gordon and Paul Heyman secretly planned to use the occasion to publicly break from the NWA and relaunch ECW as its own standalone entity. Gordon and Heyman had lost faith in the NWA to provide any value to them as wrestling promoters. Additionally, instead of offering cooperation and mutual support, other member promotions of the NWA were undermining ECW's business with underhanded tactics, something Gordon and Heyman wanted revenge for.  \n\nAt the NWA World Title Tournament held on August 27, 1994, Douglas threw down the NWA World Heavyweight Championship title upon winning it, stating that he did not want to be champion of a \"dead promotion\" that \"died seven years ago.\" He then raised the Eastern Championship Wrestling title belt and declared it to be a World Heavyweight Championship – calling it the only real world title left in professional wrestling. When recalling this event years later, Paul Heyman stated the following in a 1998 chat:\n\nNWA representative Dennis Coralluzzo was interviewed after the event and declared that Douglas would be the world champion of the NWA \"whether he likes it or not\", calling Douglas' actions a \"disgrace\" and said he would move to have Douglas stripped of both the NWA World Heavyweight Championship and the Eastern Championship Wrestling Heavyweight Championship, as he was \"undeserving\" of both titles. Gordon made the following announcement on the next edition of ECW programming:\n\nDouglas' metaphorical and literal casting down of the NWA and Gordon's subsequent renaming of the promotion were later considered the definitive beginning of Extreme Championship Wrestling as not just an independent promotion, but a prominent player in American professional wrestling.\n\n1995 to 1999: Rapid growth and launch of pay-per-view events \nECW Arena shows and television syndication expansion\n\nthumb|upright|The former ECW Arena as it appeared in 2010. The former \"Bingo Hall\" was ECW's primary venue for the majority of its existence.\nECW's primary venue was the ECW Arena, a former warehouse secluded under a section of Interstate 95. Seating comprised simple folding chairs and four sets of portable bleachers, with the unconventional scene reflective of the gritty style of the promotion itself. It was from this venue that ECW's TV show ECW Hardcore TV was filmed for broadcast on a Philadelphia local cable sports station (SportsChannel America's local affiliate, SportsChannel Philadelphia) on Tuesday evenings. After Sports Channel Philadelphia went off the air in 1997, the show moved to WPPX-TV 61. It later moved to a former independent broadcast station (WGTW 48) in Philadelphia on either Friday or Saturday night, and at 1:00a.m. or at 2:00a.m. Shows were also aired on the MSG Network in NYC on Friday nights (early Saturday morning) at 2:00a.m. Due to the obscurity of the stations and ECW itself, as well as the lack of FCC oversight at that late hour, many times expletives and violence were not edited out of these showings, along with extensive use of copyrighted music and music videos.\n\nIn 1995, Tod Gordon sold Extreme Championship Wrestling, to his head booker, Paul Heyman, trading as HHG Corporation. Afterward, Gordon remained in ECW as a figurehead commissioner. Years after being the ECW \"Commissioner\", Gordon left ECW in May 1997; his absence was explained on-air that he retired from wrestling due to family. Rumors circulated, however, that Gordon was fired by Heyman after he was suspected as a \"locker room mole\" for a rival wrestling promotion, helping to lure talent to World Championship Wrestling.\n\nthumb|upright|The Sandman held the ECW World Heavyweight Championship a record five times\n\nCross-promotion with the WWF and USWA\nStoryline-wise, Vince McMahon first became \"aware\" of ECW while at the 1995 King of the Ring event in ECW's home base of Philadelphia. During the match between Mabel and Savio Vega, the crowd suddenly started to chant, \"ECW! ECW! ECW!\". On September 22, 1996, at the In Your House: Mind Games event in Philadelphia, ECW stars The Sandman, Tommy Dreamer, Paul Heyman, and Taz were in the front row with Sandman even interfering in one match (when he threw beer on Savio Vega during his strap match with Bradshaw). McMahon acknowledged ECW's status as a local, up-and-coming promotion on the air. The following night on WWF Monday Night RAW, broadcast on September 23, 1996, at the onset of a match between The Bodydonnas vs. The British Bulldog and Owen Hart, Bill Alfonso, and Taz could be seen invading the program. Both Taz and Alfonso were able to successfully jump the security rails, and Taz was able to prominently display a bright orange sign with black lettering that read \"Sabu Fears Taz-ECW\". On February 24, 1997, ECW \"invaded\" Raw from the Manhattan Center. They advanced a storyline, plugged their first ever pay-per-view and worked three matches in front of the WWF audience while McMahon called the action with both Jerry \"The King\" Lawler and Paul Heyman. The Manhattan Center in New York was peppered with a large number of ECW fans, who gave the WWF wrestlers \"Boring!\" chants when they felt it was warranted. Likewise, when the ECW performers arrived, they popped and introduced the WWF Monday night audience to some trademark ECW group chants. This invasion sparked an inter-promotional feud between ECW and Lawler's United States Wrestling Association. Lawler disparaged ECW on-camera and convinced wrestlers such as Rob Van Dam and Sabu to join him in an anti-ECW crusade. Throughout 1997, ECW wrestlers appeared on USWA television programs, and vice versa. As part of the working relationship between ECW and the WWF, a number of WWF-contracted wrestlers were sent to ECW for seasoning in 1997, including Droz and Brakkus.\n\nGaining access to pay-per-view broadcasting\nAfter approximately 18 months of negotiating with pay-per-view providers, ECW broadcast their first pay-per-view (PPV) wrestling card, Barely Legal, on April 13, 1997, highlighted by Terry Funk defeating Raven to win the ECW World Heavyweight Championship. Gaining access to PPV was seen both internally and externally as a major milestone for ECW as it added a major revenue stream to the company in addition to greatly expanding the size of the company's audience. Although Barely Legal was broadcast from the ECW arena, ECW's transition to PPV would see ECW gaining access to much larger venues. For example, ECW's November to Remember 1997 PPV just months later saw the company perform before 4,634 fans at the Golden Dome in Monaca, Pennsylvania. \n\nIn June 1997, the company's Wrestlepalooza '97 event featured Raven's final ECW match before leaving for WCW. In this match, Tommy Dreamer finally beat Raven, his longtime nemesis. Dreamer's celebration was short-lived, though, as Jerry Lawler, along with Sabu and Rob Van Dam showed up to attack Dreamer. This set up a match between Dreamer and Lawler at the pay-per-view, 1997 Hardcore Heaven, on August 17, which was won by Dreamer. ECW continued through 1998 and early 1999 with a string of successful pay-per-views.\n\n1999 to 2000: National television and talent departures \nthumb|Paul Heyman appears with ECW security guard Ronnie Lang in 1998\nthumb|upright|Mike Awesome left ECW for WCW whilst still reigning as ECW World Heavyweight Champion.\nIn August 1999, ECW began to broadcast nationally on TNN (for what was initially a three-year contract) as ECW on TNN. Despite very limited advertising, a minimal budget, and disputes with TNN (reflected in The Network stable), ECW became TNN's highest rated show and bolstered TNN's Friday night slot, both in ratings and line-up. However, within weeks of debuting on TNN ECW was raided by the WWF, who hired away reigning ECW World Champion Taz as well reigning ECW Tag-team Champions the Dudley Boyz. Furthermore, in April 2000 reigning ECW World Heavyweight Champion Mike Awesome jumped ship to WCW in a move completely unforeseen by ECW. \n\nIt has been suggested that Awesome refused to sign a new contract with ECW until Paul Heyman paid him overdue wages. There were rumors that WCW Executive Vice-President Eric Bischoff wanted Awesome to drop the ECW World Championship belt in the trash can on television, as had been done previously with the WWF Women's title by Madusa when she jumped from the WWF to WCW. After Paul Heyman filed an injunction, WCW refrained from having Awesome appear on Nitro with the belt, but did acknowledge him as the champion. Eventually, a compromise was reached. Awesome (a WCW employee and the reigning ECW World Heavyweight champion) appeared at an April 13, 2000, ECW event in Indianapolis, Indiana, where he lost the title to Taz (who was working for the World Wrestling Federation). Taz would then lose the title to Tommy Dreamer at CyberSlam 2000 to return the title to ECW's possession, ending what is considered to have been one of the more peculiar arrangements in professional wrestling history.\n\n2000 to 2001: Cancellation of ECW on TNN and collapse\nBy October 2000, ECW on TNN was cancelled (with the final episode airing on October 6, 2000) in favor of WWF Raw is War moving to TNN. Paul Heyman stated he believed that the inability to land another national television deal was the cause of ECW's demise.\n\nthumb|Heyman addressing the crowd at an ECW television taping in 1999\nECW struggled for months after the cancellation, trying to secure a new national television deal. On December 30, 2000, ECW Hardcore TV aired for the last time and the January 7, 2001, broadcast of Guilty as Charged was ECW's last PPV. ECW's January 13, 2001 show in Pine Bluff, Arkansas would prove to be its final event of any kind. Living Dangerously was scheduled to air on March 11, 2001, but because of financial trouble it was canceled in February. Heyman could not get out of financial trouble; the PPV distributors would not pay the money that was owed to ECW due to Heyman still not being able to sign with a TV network. Consequently, ECW closed on April 4, 2001. Heyman, who became color commentator for Raw is War that February (replacing Jerry Lawler, who quit the WWF in protest after his then-wife, Stacy Carter, had been fired by McMahon), had supposedly never told his wrestlers that ECW was on its last legs and was unable to pay them for a while. Heyman also noted in later years that he had made an effort to put ECW on the USA Network (then the former home of Raw is War) unsuccessfully, despite McMahon having sent an email encouraging USA Network executive Steven Chau to add ECW to their programming.\n\nECW was listed as having assets totalling $1,385,500. Included in that number was $860,000 in accounts receivable owed to ECW by In Demand Network (PPV), Acclaim (video games) and Original San Francisco Toy Company (action figures). The balance of the assets were the video tape library ($500,000), a 1998 Ford truck ($19,500) and the remaining inventory of merchandise ($4). The liabilities of ECW totalled $8,881,435.17. Wrestlers and talent were listed, with amounts owed ranging from $2 for Sabu and Steve Corino to hundreds, and in some cases, thousands of dollars. The highest amounts owed to talents were Rob Van Dam ($150,000), Shane Douglas ($145,000),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHANWlcQPg&t=474s  Tommy Dreamer ($100,000), Joey Styles ($50,480), Rhyno ($50,000), and Francine Fournier ($47,275).\n\nMany ECW wrestlers moved to the World Wrestling All-Stars (WWA), XWF, Ring of Honor and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) which were all formed after the end of ECW and WCW.\n\n2001 to 2007: The Invasion and acquisition by WWE \n\nA few months after ECW's 2001 demise, ECW resurfaced as a stable as part of the World Wrestling Federation's (WWF, later WWE) Invasion storyline. On the July 9, 2001, edition of Raw is War, Heyman, who had been hired by the WWF as Raw color commentator while ECW was still in bankruptcy proceedings, joined several former ECW alumni on the WWF roster (including the debuting Rob Van Dam and Tommy Dreamer) and claimed that he was bringing ECW back to participate in the Invasion by themselves (at the time, however, the ownership of ECW, including the use of its name on-air, was disputed despite Heyman still technically owning ECW when he jumped ship to the WWF. In addition, WWF faced legal action by Harry Slash & The Slashtones for the use of the song \"This Is Extreme!\" which was eventually settled). Before Raw is War was over that evening, Heyman and Shane McMahon, who had (kayfabe) purchased World Championship Wrestling (WCW), revealed that they were in cahoots with each other and that Heyman had (also kayfabe) sold ECW to Stephanie McMahon, forming The Alliance to try and wrestle power from Vince McMahon. At that time, the original inter-promotional feud devolved into another internal power struggle among the McMahon family. The defection of WWF superstars to The Alliance continued the shift as less focus was placed on WCW and ECW performers – in fact, with rare exceptions such as Van Dam, the ECW alumni in The Alliance were given even less focus than WCW's performers, with WCW's logo even representing the entire stable. The feud lasted six months and concluded with WWF defeating The Alliance at the 2001 Survivor Series when Kurt Angle attacked Stone Cold Steve Austin, allowing The Rock, who had himself gotten attacked by Chris Jericho during the match (trying to help The Alliance in the process), to get the winning pinfall. The WWF's victory also marked the end of the Invasion storyline and WCW and ECW wrestlers were reintegrated into the WWF.\n\nOn January 28, 2003, World Wrestling Entertainment Inc. purchased ECW's assets from HHG Corporation in court, acquiring the rights to ECW's video library. HHG would nominally remain active until it became defunct on January 31, 2007.\n\nReunions and revivals\n2004 Rise and Fall of ECW documentary \n\nFollowing World Wrestling Entertainment Inc.'s purchase of ECW's assets in January 2003, they used the video library to put together a two-disc DVD titled The Rise and Fall of ECW, which was released in November 2004. The main feature of the DVD set was a nearly three-hour documentary on the company's history, with the other disc featuring 7 matches from the promotion. The documentary proved to be one of the most popular pieces of media ever produced by WWE, with DVDs of the documentary selling in the 100,000s.  \n\nIn June 2005 an unauthorized DVD called Forever Hardcore was written, directed and produced by Jeremy Borash in response to The Rise and Fall of ECW. The DVD featured interviews with ECW alumni who were not employed by WWE telling their side of ECW's history. \n\nThe success of Rise and Fall of ECW and Forever Hardcore led to WWE reassessing the value of the ECW brand and directly resulted in WWE hosting ECW One Night Stand 2005 to further test how much strength remained in the ECW fandom.\n\nWWE\n\nthumb|Rob Van Dam in an ECW ring in April 2007, a year after the relaunch\nBy 2005, WWE began reintroducing ECW through content from the ECW video library and a series of books, which included the release of The Rise and Fall of ECW documentary. With heightened and rejuvenated interest in the ECW franchise, WWE organized ECW One Night Stand on June 12, a reunion event that featured ECW alumni. Shane McMahon had the idea of an online, low budget show, but they asked television stations and PPV producers and they were interested in ECW.\n\nDue to the financial and critical success of the production, WWE produced the second ECW One Night Stand on June 11, 2006, which served as the premiere show of the relaunch of the ECW franchise as a WWE brand, complementary to Raw and SmackDown. On June 13, Heyman, the brand's former owner and newly appointed figurehead for the ECW brand, recommissioned the ECW World Heavyweight Championship to be the brand's world title and awarded it to Rob Van Dam as a result of winning the WWE Championship at ECW One Night Stand 2006. During the first few months of ECW on Sci Fi, the show operated under the creative direction of Paul Heyman and was supervised by Vince McMahon. The ECW brand initially retained many elements of the wild and ruckus original ECW promotion, but gradually over the following months these were scaled back at the behest of McMahon and the show was brought in line with other WWE productions. This caused considerable discontent with Heyman, who walked off the project and left WWE entirely in December 2006, beginning a six-year hiatus from professional wrestling.   \n\nWWE's ECW brand would continue to operate until February 16, 2010, when it became defunct and replaced with NXT. Today, there are a handful of WWE-produced events that followed the legacy of the original ECW – Extreme Rules and Heatwave.\n\nOther reunions\nHardcore Homecoming\nOn the same weekend as the ECW One Night Stand 2005 event another reunion show was held at the ECW Arena. Booked and promoted by Shane Douglas, Cody Michaels and Jeremy Borash, Hardcore Homecoming was held on June 10, 2005. The show featured former ECW performers who were not contracted to work the WWE produced event. Because of the success of the initial event, three additional shows were held in Autumn 2005 and later the DVD documentary Forever Hardcore was released by the same production crew as a counterpart to WWE's Rise and Fall of ECW.\n\nHardcore Justice in TNA\nthumb|Tommy Dreamer in TNA after his debut in 2010. He subsequently founded the House of Hardcore promotion in 2012.\nFollowing Tommy Dreamer's June 2010 debut in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), a new stable was formed called EV2.0 consisting of former ECW alumni. TNA President Dixie Carter agreed to give the stable their own reunion show at TNA's annual Hard Justice pay-per-view. Billed as the last ECW reunion show, Hardcore Justice aired on August 8, 2010. EV2.0 remained on the active roster for the remainder of the year.\n\nExtreme Rising\nIn 2012 Shane Douglas led a project called Extreme Reunion, later renamed Extreme Rising.Extreme Rising « Events Database « CAGEMATCH. Cagematch.net. Retrieved on September 5, 2013. The concept of the promotion was to produce shows in the style of ECW and feature new and upcoming talent, rather than strictly only feature ECW alumni. The promotion ran several shows in 2012 but folded soon thereafter.\n\nHouse of Hardcore\nIn 2012, Dreamer founded House of Hardcore (HOH), a wrestling promotion named after the ECW wrestling school and inspired by the hardcore style of wrestling. Since then, HOH has held numerous wrestling events mainly in areas where ECW was held such as the ECW Arena.\n\nControversies\nthumb|200px|ECW roster member New Jack.\nThroughout its existence, ECW cultivated an image of a rebellious organization that lived on the edge and \"pushed the envelope\". Not only did ECW engage in a wrestling style considered more dangerous than its larger competitors, but it also performed riskier and more controversial angles (storylines) as well. This culture within the company sometimes led to major controversies within the professional wrestling industry. \n\nOne such instance was the \"Sandman crucifixion angle\" at ECW High Incident. As part of a long-running storyline between Raven and The Sandman, Sandman was attacked by Raven's Nest, which included The Sandman's real-life wife Lori Fullington and their young son Tyler, who in the storyline had become devotees of Raven. As part of the attack, a wooden cross was brought from under the ring and the members of Raven's Nest proceeded to \"crucify\" Sandman with it, and enforced the use of religious iconography by placing a \"crown\" made out of barbed wire on his head in a direct allusion to the Crucifixion of Jesus. ECW's normally rowdy crowd was shocked into silence and the angle was immediately considered to have backfired. That same night, Raven was forced to make an out-of-character apology to the live audience. The footage of the \"crucifixion\" was never aired on ECW television. Olympian wrestler Kurt Angle, who was in attendance for the show and who had been considering wrestling for ECW in the future, immediately left the ECW Arena in disgust due to the incident.\n\nAnother instance of a high controversy that occurred in ECW was the Mass Transit incident. The Mass Transit incident took place during an ECW house show on November 23, 1996, at the Wonderland Ballroom in Revere, Massachusetts. 17-year-old Erich Kulas, an aspiring professional wrestler who used the ring name \"Mass Transit,\" was seriously injured in a tag-team match against The Gangstas; the most severe injury occurred when Kulas was bladed too deeply by New Jack (Jerome Young), severing two of his arteries. Further controversy arose when it came to light that Kulas had lied to ECW owner and booker Paul Heyman about his age and professional wrestling training. The incident led to the temporary cancellation of the inaugural ECW pay-per-view Barely Legal, and legal action against New Jack. Due to Kulas's deception, however, Barely Legal was reinstated and the legal action ended in Young's favor.\n\nIn July 2000, ECW made its West Coast debut, holding its annual summer pay-per-view Heat Wave in Los Angeles, California. At the time Los Angeles was home to Xtreme Pro Wrestling (XPW), a recently established promotion which imitated the style and presentation of ECW. Six members of the XPW roster purchased front-row tickets to the PPV and attended the show. Prior to the start of the main event, a legitimate out-of-character brawl broke out between the XPW contingent and members of the ECW roster, which spilled out into the parking lot of the venue. Although ECW and XPW as organizations were considered to have great dislike for each other, several ECW talent would perform for XPW following the folding of ECW in 2001.\n\nLegacy\n\nthumb|Hardcore Hall of Fame banners commemorating The Public Enemy hang at the 2300 Arena.\nECW was very influential within professional wrestling in the 1990s and several elements innovated and introduced by ECW would continue to be used in professional wrestling decades after its closure. \n\nIn the immediate aftermath of ECW collapse, a significant portion of ECW's active roster was brought into the WWF. These former ECW talents would be used as part of a storyline that ran in the WWF throughout 2001 that pitted the WWF against the \"invading\" WCW and ECW. The storyline began proper at the WWF Invasion pay-per-view, which received 775,000 buys and became one of the highest-grossing wrestling pay-per-views of all time. The storyline ran until November's Survivor Series, and thereafter former ECW talent were integrated into the WWF without being directly tied to the ECW branding. Former ECW talent such as Rob Van Dam would be prominent parts of WWF/WWE programming thereafter. Outside of the WWF, former ECW talent were integral in helping new promotions find their feet. Alumni such as Raven were important figures during the startup phase of NWA: Total Nonstop Action and Ring of Honor. Many promotions, such as Combat Zone Wrestling and Xtreme Pro Wrestling, attempted to directly imitate ECW and capture its audience once it folded, to the point that these companies directly competed for control of the ECW Arena.   Throughout the 2000s, ECW's home base of Philadelphia was considered a highly potent source of fans for Independent wrestling promotions.   \n\nFollowing the release of commercially successful ECW retrospectives by WWE in the mid-2000s, WWE tapped into the legacy of ECW with reunion shows before attempting to fully revive ECW. This move was mirrored all across American professional wrestling, with several independent revivals springing up and several established promotions pivoting their content to incorporate hardcore wrestling and former ECW stars. After the relaunch of the ECW brand, it initially shifted focus from original ECW alumni toward experimenting with new and upcoming talent. This laid the groundwork for NXT, which would evolve into WWE’s primary developmental brand and gain critical acclaim for its experimental nature and emphasis on emerging talent. After the ECW brand was dissolved, its legacy remains through NXT’s focus on new talent and its appeal to a dedicated fanbase reminiscent of ECW’s innovative and rebellious spirit.\n\nThe former ECW Arena, now known as the 2300 Arena, is host to the Hardcore Hall of Fame, which recognizes its history with hardcore wrestling.\n\nChampionships and programming\nChampionships\n  Championship  Notes Extreme Championship Wrestling titlesECW World Heavyweight ChampionshipThe world title of ECW.

    "clean_text": "Mams Taylor is a British boxing promoter, talent manager, and musician. He is the President/CEO of Proper Loud and Co-President of Misfits Boxing.\n\nMusic career \nTaylor's song \"LA Girls\" featuring Joel Madden of Good Charlotte was featured on the MTV show, The Hills. In addition to Taylor, the music video for \"LA Girls\" also stars former UFC Light Heavyweight Champion Quinton Jackson, Mila Kunis, and Carmen Electra.\n\nA later single of Taylor's called \"Girls Gotta Girlfriend\" featured Snoop Dogg, and Bobby Valentino was inspired by the openness about female bisexuality in Hollywood.  \n\nIn May 2013, Taylor teamed up with producer Ben Rico and formed the production/writing duo called Feelabeat. They produced and wrote a single for Carmen Electra, titled \"Bigger Dick\".\n\n \"United for Neda\" \nTaylor wrote and produced \"United for Neda\", which is a protest song recorded in English and Persian versions by many famous Iranian expatriates. It was inspired by the plight of Neda Agha-Soltan, a 26-year-old Iranian woman who was fatally shot on the streets of Tehran on 20 June 2010 by the Basij. Her death was recorded on a mobile phone video and received international attention when it hit the Internet.\n\nTaylor invested one million dollars into Lady Gaga's career before she had commercially released any music and worked closely with her team as part of Coalition and Atom Factory. However, it ended up in a dispute which appears to have been settled.\n\nTaylor has written, produced and collaborated with a wide range of notable artists, such as Tiësto, Good Charlotte, Travis Barker, Robbie Williams, Rico Love, Billy Idol, T-Pain, Lil' Kim, The Game, Papa Roach, Snoop Dogg, Rodney Jerkins, Scott Storch, Dave Navarro, among others.\n\nIn May 2013, Taylor teamed up with producer Ben Rico and formed the production/writing duo called Feelabeat. They produced and wrote a single for Carmen Electra, titled \"Bigger Dick\".\n\nTaylor executive produced former Pussycat Doll Jessica Sutta's debut album, which charted in numerous territories and also achieved two number-ones on the Billboard Dance charts. \n\nTaylor executive produced KSI's debut album Dissimulation, which debuted at number 2 on the UK Albums Chart and reached the charts in 13 other countries. He also executive produced KSI's sophomore album All Over The Place, which charted at number 1 on the UK Albums Chart and two songs from the album were nominated at The Brit Awards for song of the year.\n\nBoxing promoter career \nOn 22 June 2021, Taylor partnered with KSI, Kalle Sauerland, Nisse Sauerland, and Wasserman Boxing to create Misfits Boxing, a boxing promotion company dedicated to hosting crossover boxing matches where influencers and celebrities compete in the ring. He is the Co-President of Misfits Boxing.\n\nBusiness ventures \n\n Proper Loud \nTaylor owns a talent management company and record label called Proper Loud (formally Premier League Music), representing songwriter Rico Love, producer Diego Ave, artist/producer S-X, YouTuber/musician/boxer KSI, internet personality King Bach, YouTube couple GoldJuice and YouTuber Jidion.\n\nProper Loud has achieved a number of accolades, 31 plaques of gold or platinum status, representing their clients and also for Taylor's creative involvement. Over the years, Taylor has facilitated major deals for his clients in publishing, recording and selling of catalogues. He earned a major deal for his client, Rico Love, with Hipgnosis Songs Fund. \n\n The Online Takeover \nOn 16 February 2021, Taylor and KSI partnered for the creation of the label named \"The Online Takeover\". The first signee of the label was American-British singer Aiyana-Lee, who featured on the track \"Killa Killa\". On 13 May 2022, KSI announced that he and Proper Loud had signed Yxng Dave to The Online Takeover, making him the second artist to be signed to the label.\n\nPersonal life \n\nOn 10 October 2010, Taylor married actress Krista Allen. Allen filed for divorce at the Los Angeles County Superior Court on 12 February 2012.\n\nControversies \n\n Hitting Jesse Metcalfe \nA video of Taylor hitting actor Jesse Metcalfe has been repeatedly featured on the television program TMZ.\n\nDiscography\n Studio albums \n Title Details King Amongst Men: The Lost Album Released: 24 November 2009\n Label: Premier League Music\n Formats: Digital download, streaming, CD\n\n Mixtapes \n Title Details The R-Evolution of Runk Released: 18 August 2009\n Label: Premier League Music\n Formats: Digital download, CD\n\n Singles \n Title Year \"Girls Gotta Girlfriend\"2009\n\nOther credits\n+ List of songs executive produced or written, showing year released and album nameTitleYearArtistCreditsCertificationsAlbum\"Rich 'N Thuggin'\"2011Glasses MaloneProducerBeach Cruiser\"Bigger Dick\"2013Carmen ElectraSongwriter\"Water Into Wine\"2016Jessica SuttaFeline Resurrection\"Diving Deep\"\"Torn Fishnets & Broken Heels\"\"Get Lost\"\"Sunday Island\"2017SongwriterI Say Yes\"Lot On My Mind\"2019S-XTrue Colours\"Wake Up Call\"  2020KSI BPI: SilverDissimulation\"Inside My Sin\"Aiyana-Lee\"Bad Lil Vibe\"  KSIDissimulation\"Lose\"  2021Executive producerAll Over the Place\"Clear Out Time\"S-XSongwriter A Repeat Wouldn’t Go A Miss \"All Night\"  2022Things Change\"Summer Is Over\"KSIComposer\n\nAwards and nominations \n Year Award Category Recipient(s) Result 2022  Music Week Awards Manager of the Year Himself",

Prior to the establishment of the regions, she was mayor of Copenhagen County.\n\nEarly life\nVibeke Storm Rasmussen is the daughter of chief mechanic Jørgen Rasmussen and nurse Birte Storm, and grew up on Amager. She graduated highschool in 1964, and in 1969 she finished her education as a public school teacher. Vibeke Storm Rasmussen has written several books and pamphlets on education. From 1974 to 1993, she worked in Ballerup Municipality as a consultant in the school system, focusing among other things on children from ethnic minorities and their school-related problems.\n\nPolitical career\nAfter graduating she became a member of the Social Democratic Youth of Denmark. In 1974, she was elected to the city council in Albertslund Municipality as the only woman. She set up an interest group aimed at engaging more women in politics. She has run for parliament and sometimes served as a substitute therein, but her primary focus has been regional politics. In 1984, she was elected to the county council of Copenhagen County, and in 1992 became its first female county mayor. She was re-elected in 1997 and in 2001, continuing until the county was disbanded as a result of the Danish municipal reform.\n\nIn the first election for the council of the Capital Region of Denmark, in 2005, Vibeke Storm Rasmussen ran in the election as the leader of the Social Democrats. She received 47,000 personal votes. Having formed an agreement with the Socialist People's Party and the Red-Green Alliance, she became the first chairman of the Capital Region of Denmark, as well as the first female regional chairman in Denmark.\n\nShe did not run for election in November 2013. Instead Sophie Hæstorp Andersen (born 26 September 1974 in Copenhagen) ran as the leader of the Social Democrats and was elected as chairman of the regional council. Sophie is one of two regional chairmen who are women.",

His Norwegian born father worked as a scientist at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory research facility. Aaland was an Eagle Scout who attended Livermore High School, where he played football. He graduated from California State University, Chico with a major in photojournalism and was an All-American swimmer on the NCAA Division II championship team.\n\nBeginning career\nIn 1978, Aaland published his first book, Sweat: The Illustrated History and Description of the Finnish Sauna, Russian Bania, Islamic Hammam, Japanese Mushi-buro, Mexican Temescal, and American Indian & Eskimo Sweat Lodge. The book was the culmination of a three-year travel and photo-journalistic tour of the world's various bathing customs. Aaland continues to be an active proponent and historian of sweat bathing.\n\nAaland published his second nonfiction book, County Fair: Portraits (1981) after spending nine years traveling the United States visiting county fairs. Jon Carroll wrote in New West magazine, \"(County Fair) is a chronicle of people being who they are. These faces become historical.\" The photographer Mary Ellen Mark said of the book: \"Such moving photographs, funny and sad. It's real Americana. Aaland is a latter day Mike Disfarmer.\" In 1982, Aaland appeared as a guest on the David Letterman Show, sharing work from both Sweat and County Fair.\n\nDuring an interview in 1981, Aaland was introduced to the newly emerging field of digital photography by renowned photographer Ansel Adams. He contributed articles and photos for other publications such as American Photographer, FOTO, American Photo, Digital Creativity, Newsweek, The Washington Post, Popular Science, and Wired. In 1981, he received the National Art Director's award for photography.\n\nDigital photography instruction\nAaland was one of the first to write about digital photography. In the 1980s he wrote covered the topic in a regular column on the topic for American Photographer, and as West Coast editor of Swedish magazine FOTO. In 1992, Aaland released the book Digital Photography. The book gives instruction and tips on using digital cameras to take unique photographs. He followed that with Still Images in Multimedia (1996) and then Shooting Digital: Pro Tips for Taking Great Pictures with Your Digital Camera (2003), which was named by Designer's Bookshelf as \"Best Digital Photography Book of the Year for 2004.\"\n\nAaland was the co-host of the Nordic Light International Festival of Photography between 2011 and 2018.\n\nBeginning in 2001, Aaland began publishing a number of guidebooks about using the computer design program Photoshop to enhance digital photography; Photoshop Elements Solutions: The Art of Digital Photography was followed by second, third, and fourth volumes. He also acted as an unpaid adviser to the development of both the alpha, beta, and final versions of the Adobe Photoshop Elements application. Photoshop CS2 RAW: Using Adobe Camera Raw, Bridge, and Photoshop to Get the Most Out of Your Digital Camera (2006) was Aaland's first of two books explaining the graphic file format RAW, which is used by professional photographers.\n\nWhile working as an adviser on beta tests for Adobe Lightroom, Aaland proposed a real-world test of the software by inviting professional photographers to travel to a far-off land where they would use Lightroom. The result of this was Photoshop Lightroom Adventure: Mastering Adobe's Next-generation Tool for Digital Photographers (2007), which brought professional photographers to Iceland to test the software. Aaland followed up that book the same year with Photoshop Lightroom 2 Adventure: Mastering Adobe's Next-generation Tool for Digital Photographers, which brought professional photographers to Tasmania to show users how photographers work with the Lightroom 2 software.\n\n Memoir and travel work \nIn a diversion from photography instruction, Aaland published The Sword of Heaven: A Five Continent Odyssey to Save the World (1999), detailing the six years he spent traveling around the world documenting a peace project initiated by survivors of Hiroshima and led by a Shinto priest. During this time, Aaland dropped brick-sized pieces of a holy Shinto Sword of Heaven into bodies of water around the world to form a protective ring of kami.\n\nAaland's most recent book, The River in My Backyard, is an illustrated memoir exploring his family history, the murder of his father, and his pilgrimage to Mount Kailash.\n\nIn 1984, Wired sent Aaland to Paris to interview filmmaker Chris Marker. The interview was later published as the cover story of Digital Creativity. Following the interview, the two became friends and correspondents. Aaland is currently working on a project that will honor Marker.\n\n Sweat bathing \nAaland, as the author of Sweat: The Illustrated History and Description of the Finnish Sauna, Russian Bania, Islamic Hammam, Japanese Mushi-buro, Mexican Temescal, and American Indian & Eskimo Sweat Lodge, is recognized as an authority for sweat bathing. In 2014, Aaland organized the Perfect Sweat Summit in San Francisco, bringing together 50 international experts on sweat bathing. \n\nAaland is co-host of the travel documentary series, Perfect Sweat, which combines his career-long interests in photography, travel, and sweat bathing. The seven-episode documentary series is an exploration of bathing traditions around the world and revisits the topic of his 1978 book Sweat.\n\nHe is also an honorary member of the International Sauna Association (ISA) and the British Sauna Society and a co-founder and board member of the Norwegian Sauna Association (Badstulaug).\n\n Philanthropy \nAs the president of the International Sauna Aid Foundation, Aaland helped bring mobile saunas to Ukraine, aiding communities affected by war. He also set up saunas for first responders during the January 2025 Southern California wildfires.",

She was soon renamed Temegan II and then Riette.  The U.S. Navy acquired Riette from her owner, Dr. George G. Shelton of Ridgefield, Connecticut, on 19 May 1917 for use as a patrol boat during World War I. She was commissioned on 5 August 1917 as USS Riette (SP-107) at the New York Navy Yard in Brooklyn, New York.\n\nRiette served as a patrol vessel at Base No. 3, Port Jefferson, New York, in late 1917 and at Base No. 2, Black Rock, in Bridgeport, Connecticut, from May 1918 to July 1918. From 13 August 1918 she was based at Iona Island, New York. She later provided special service for the Machinery Division at the New York Navy Yard.\n\nRiette was decommissioned on 14 August 1919. She was sold on 30 October 1919 at Brooklyn to H. H. Miller of Brooklyn.\n\nRe-engined in 1922 and again in 1930, Riette remained on yacht registers until 1958.",

    "clean_text": "Alphonse \"Alphonso\" Trent (October 24, 1902 – October 14, 1959) was an American jazz pianist and territory band leader.\n\nEarly life\nTrent was born in Fort Smith, Arkansas on October 24, 1902. He played piano from childhood and worked in local bands in Arkansas through his youth.\n\nLater life and career\nHe led his first band in the mid-1920s, possibly as early as 1923. In 1924 he played with Eugene Cook's Synco Six, and then took over leadership of the band, which played until 1934, playing mostly in the American South and Midwest, as well as on steamboats. Despite success in New York around 1930, Trent chose not to work further on the East Coast.\n\nHe left music in the mid-1930s but returned with another band in 1938. His sidemen included Terrence Holder, Alex Hill, Stuff Smith, Snub Mosley, Charlie Christian, Sweets Edison, Mouse Randolph, and Peanuts Holland. As leader, he recorded only eight sides: four in 1928, two in 1930, and two in 1933. He died in Fort Smith on October 14, 1959.\n\nHis small recorded legacy has made him a somewhat obscure figure today, but the sophistication of his arrangements and the precision with which they were executed inspired awe in contemporaries - one such, Budd Johnson (quoted by Gunther Schuller via The Jazz Review) stated: Let me tell you about Trent... They were gods back in the twenties, just like Basie was, only many years ahead of him... They worked nothing but the biggest and finest hotels in the South... They were years ahead of their time.Schuller, Early Jazz, 1968; p.299",

He studied in Lyon then in Paris. He joined a Maoist group for a while but quickly became convinced that immigrants should retain their political sovereignty and therefore found their own structures. This is what pushed him, in the context of the Six Day War of 1967 and May 68 to participate in the founding of the Palestine Committee which will become the  in 1973. He also founded the Committee for the Defense of life and rights of immigrant workers.Saïd Bouziri : l'humain au coeur de la vie\n\nIn 1972, as part of the Marcellin-Fontanet circular, an expulsion order targeted him, as well as his wife, because of his activities.Répertoire numérique détaillé du fonds Saïd Bouziri He then started a hunger strike to assert his rights which had a great impact.

    "title": "Tohono Oʼodham Nation",
    "clean_text": "The Tohono Oʼodham Nation is the collective government body of the Tohono Oʼodham tribe in the United States. The Tohono Oʼodham Nation governs four separate sections of land with a combined area of , approximately the size of Connecticut and the second-largest Indigenous land holding in the United States. These lands are in the Sonoran Desert of south central Arizona and border the Mexico–United States border for . The Nation is organized into 11 local districts and has a tripartite system of government. Sells is the Nation's largest community and functions as its capital. The Nation has about 34,000 enrolled members, most of whom live off of the reservations.\n\nHistory\nIn 1874, President of the United States Ulysses S. Grant signed an executive order creating the San Xavier Indian Reservation, surrounding the 18th-century Mission San Xavier del Bac. In 1882, President Chester A. Arthur signed an executive order creating the Gila Bend Indian Reservation as additional lands for the Tohono Oʼodham people. In 1916, a third reservation was created by executive order with Indian Oasis (now Sells, Arizona) as its headquarters. In 1937, The Tohono Oʼodham Nation, then called the Papagos Tribe of Arizona, adopted its first constitution.\n\nIn 1960, the Army Corps of Engineers completed construction of the Painted Rock Dam on the Gila River. Flood waters impounded by the dam periodically inundated approximately  of the Gila Bend Indian Reservation. The area the tribe lost contained a  farm and several communities. Residents were relocated to a  parcel of land named San Lucy Village, near Gila Bend, Arizona. In January 1986, the enrolled members of the three reservations adopted a new tribal constitution that changed the tribe name from Papago Tribe of Arizona to the Tohono Oʼodham Nation and adopted a three-branch form of government. Also in 1986, the federal government and the Nation approved a settlement whereby the Nation agreed to give up its legal claims in exchange for $30,000,000 and the right to add replacement land to its reservation.\n\nIn 2009, the tribe announced that it had purchased approximately  near Glendale, Arizona. The city of Glendale and the Gila River Indian Community opposed attempts to develop the land though court challenges and supporting a measure passed by the Arizona House of Representatives that would allow the city of Glendale to incorporate land the tribe owned, making it ineligible for inclusion within the reservation. , after a change of heart, the City of Glendale has been negotiating with the Nation over its proposed West Valley casino. The McCain-Franks bill was designed to prohibit the Glendale project and in the process would have changed federal law by unilaterally repealing critical parts of the Gila Bend Indian Reservation Lands Replacement Act, which was passed to settle a dispute over federal flooding of tribal reservation lands.\n\nIn 2009, the Nation acquired  of land near Why, Arizona, with the intention of eventually creating a new district of the Tohono Oʼodham Nation for the Hia C-eḍ Oʼodham. On October 30, 2012, a new tribal law created the Hia-Ced District as the new 12th district of the Tohono Oʼodham Nation. On April 25, 2015, the Hia-Ced District was dissolved by referendum vote, returning the Nation to its original 11 districts.\n\nPeople\n\nMost Tohono Oʼodham people live in the United States. A small number are across the international border in northwestern Mexico. The Tohono Oʼodham Nation speaks a common language, Oʼodham, which is the 10th most-spoken indigenous language in the United States. While the people are nominally Catholic, the Nation's schools teach native language and culture.\n\nThe Nation has about 34,000 enrolled members. Most of its members live off the reservations. The main reservation, Tohono Oʼodham Indian Reservation, has a resident population of about 11,000. The San Xavier Indian Reservation has a resident population of 1,200. The Gila Bend Indian Reservation has a population of about 1,700, and Florence Village has a population of about 195. The remaining roughly 14,600 members live off the reservations.\n\nGeography\nThe lands of the Nation are in the Sonoran Desert in south central Arizona, in areas of a series of parallel mountains and valleys. The vegetation is consistent with other parts of the Sonoran Desert. Saguaro cactus, Cholla, prickly pear, palo verde, velvet mesquite, whitethorn acacia, desert ironwood, and willow are the dominant vegetation in the landscape. The landscape is interspersed with plains and mountains. These include the Quinlan and Baboquivari Mountains, which include Kitt Peak, the Kitt Peak National Observatory and telescopes, and Baboquivari Peak.\n\nSells, Arizona, is the Nation's largest community and functions as the capital. The Tohono Oʼodham Nation occupies four separate pieces of land for a combined area of , making it the second-largest Native American land holding in the U.S. The lands include the main reservation, the Gila Bend Reservation, San Xavier Reservation, and Florence Village. Of the four lands bases, the largest is the main reservation at more than . The San Xavier reservation is the second-largest, at , just south of Tucson. The Gila Bend Indian Reservation is  and Florence Village . With the 1853 Gadsden Purchase, the territory of the Tohono Oʼodham was split between the U.S. and Mexico.  Consequently, the Nation is directly exposed to the Mexico–United States border for . There is no reservation for the Tohono Oʼodham people in Mexico, so the Nation's southern border is the Mexico–United States border.\n\nBorder issues \n\n Pre-contact to 1900 \nBefore colonization, the Oʼodham migrated along a north–south axis in a \"two village\" system, rotating between summer and winter settlements. These migrations formed the foundation of their subsistence economies and enabled religious pilgrimages. This pattern continued throughout Apache, Spanish, and American expansion, but shifted with the re-drawing of boundaries that followed the Mexican–American War. Unlike aboriginal groups along the U.S.–Canada border, the Tohono Oʼodham were not offered dual citizenship when the U.S. drew a border across their lands in 1853 by the Gadsden Purchase. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo did not specify the rights of the Oʼodham to cross the international border.Amnesty International, In Hostile Terrain, 29,32. The population was split between Mexico and the U.S., but after the treaty the U.S. government guaranteed that Oʼodham freedom of movement would be protected. For decades, members of the nation continued to move freely across the international border. Throughout this time, tribal members traveled and migrated to work, participate in religious ceremonies, keep medical appointments in Sells, and visit relatives. The Oʼodham were deliberate in attending their religious festivals, and left their employers for two to four weeks to travel to Magdalena, Sonora. Oʼodham labor was so valued that employers began to drive their Oʼodham employees to the festivals rather than lose 4–8 days of labor while tribal members traveled by wagon. The end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th saw a decline in the subsistence economies of the Oʼodham, and after the Bureau of Indian Affairs drilled wells for them, their need to migrate declined. Despite these changes, the Oʼodham continued to move through the region with their families, working as hired hands on farms, mines, and ranches where work appeared.\n\n 1900–2000 \nThe pre-contact legacy and economic lifestyles of the Oʼodham gave them a \"transnational identity\", but Indigenous conflicts on the Mexico–United States barrier arose. Land theft and forced assimilation decreased the numbers of southern Oʼodham and alienated them from their northern counterparts. By 1910, it was estimated that only 1,000 Oʼodham remained in Mexico. The disparities in wealth between the two sides also led to cultural shifts. The traditional practice of lending between Oʼodham decreased as many Arizona Oʼodham felt that those on the Mexican side would not be able to pay loans back. During WWI concerns were raised about the proximity of the Oʼodham to the border, but the U.S. government ignored requests for additional military presence, and trans-border smuggling thrived in the 1910s and 1920s. This included liquor, food, and guns. The War Department attempted to halt this, but the reporting system on such a wide area of land was slow and ineffective. The Oʼodham were accused of participating in the Yaquis' international weapons smuggling. As Mexicans were deported during the Great Depression, the Mexican government gave them Oʼodham tribal lands. Notions of isolation were further intensified during WWII as the U.S.–Mexico border was militarized to protect against potential invasions via the Sea of Cortez, and tribal lands in Sonora were privatized to increase government production. In 1977 the Los Angeles Times reported that Mexican Oʼodham were taking advantage of medical facilities and welfare checks on the Arizona side of the border. An increase in militarization occurred again in the 1980s and 1990s, further inhibiting tribal members from traveling back and forth and slowing migration. The Mexican government made gestures to improve the condition of the Oʼodham in Mexico by opening the office of the National Indian Institute, but the office struggled with inadequate resources and institutionalized corruption. In the 1980s, Oʼodham in Sonora responded to decades of land theft and bureaucratic failure by staging an occupation at the \"weak and underfunded\" National Indian Institute offices. The tribal constitution ratified in 1986 reads: \"All members of the Tohono Oʼodham Nation shall be given equal opportunity to participate in the economic resources and activities of the Tohono Oʼodham Nation.\"Tohono O'odham Nation. Constitution of The Tohono O'odham Nation. 1986. Many tribal members felt these promises were not guaranteed. At the end of the decade, Oʼodham on the Mexican side of the border wrote an \"open letter\" to Oʼodham on the American side. In it they wrote: \"our human rights and aboriginal rights have slowly been violated or disappeared in Mexico.\" This articulated the concerns of many Oʼodham about the growing international divide and population loss in Sonora. In its 1990 census, the Mexican government recorded no Oʼodham living in Sonora.\n\n 2000–present \nThe Oʼodham saw a subsequent rise in illegal crossing and smuggling through tribal lands as the surrounding security increased. In 2003 the Nation hosted a Congressional hearing on illegal activity on tribal lands. In the hearing tribal leaders and law enforcement officers testified about \"incidents of cross-border violence, and even incursions by Mexican military personnel in support of drug smugglers.\"U.S. Congress hearing. The impact of the drug trade on border security and national parks. Washington: U.S. G.P.O., 2003. Along with the cross-border violence, tribal members continued to experience other social and legal consequences from the border. Tribal members born in Mexico or who had insufficient documentation to prove U.S. birth or residency found themselves trapped in a remote corner of Mexico with no access to the tribal centers only tens of miles away. In 2001, a bill was proposed that would give citizenship to all Tohono Oʼodham, but it was forgotten in the aftermath of 9/11. Since then, bills have repeatedly been introduced in Congress to solve the \"one people-two country\" problem by granting U.S. citizenship to all enrolled members of the Tohono Oʼodham, but so far they have not passed.\"H.R.1680 – Tohono Oʼodham Citizenship Act of 2013\". 113th United States Congress (2013–2014). Sponsored by Raul M. Grijalva. Congress.gov. Retrieved 2017-02-23. Opponents of granting U.S. citizenship to all enrolled members of the Nation say that many births on the reservation have been informally recorded and the records are susceptible to easy alteration or falsification. Oʼodham can cross the border with Tribal Identification Cards, but these can be denied at the border and legal documentation on the reservation is poor. Separation from family members and detainment are possibilities for Oʼodham crossing into the United States.\nthumb|Border fence, photograph from Tohono Oʼodham Nation\nToday, the tribal government incurs extra costs due to the proximity of the U.S.–Mexico border. There are also associated social problems. In an area of acute poverty, offers from smugglers for Oʼodham to assist in illegal activity are common, and in some instances drug traffickers have purchased Oʼodham land along the border. Many of the thousands of Mexican and other nationals illegally crossing the border to work in U.S. agriculture or to smuggle drugs into the U.S. seek emergency assistance from the Tohono Oʼodham police when they become dehydrated or are stranded. On the ground, border patrol emergency rescue and tribal EMTs coordinate and communicate. The tribe and the state of Arizona pay a large proportion of the bills for border-related law enforcement and emergency services. Former Arizona governor Janet Napolitano and Tohono Oʼodham government leaders have repeatedly asked the federal government to repay the state and tribe for the costs of border-related emergencies. Tribe Chairman Ned Norris Jr. has complained about the lack of reimbursement for border enforcement.\n\nCiting the impact it would have on wildlife and on the tribe's members, Tohono Oʼodham tribal leaders made a series of official statements opposing President Donald Trump's plan to build a wall along the U.S.–Mexico border. While the 1986 Tohono Oʼodham constitution gives the tribe sovereignty over their territory, this is nonetheless subject to the plenary power of Congress. About 2,000 members live in Mexico, and a wall would physically separate them from members in the U.S. Most of the 25,000 Tohono Oʼodham today live in southern Arizona, but several thousand, many related by kinship, live in northern Sonora, Mexico. Many tribal members still make an annual pilgrimage to San Xavier del Bac and Magdalena, Sonora, during St. Francis festivities to commemorate St. Francis Xavier and St. Francis of Assisi, founder of the Franciscan Order.\n\n Integrated fixed towers \nIntegrated fixed towers (IFTs) are solar-powered structures that integrate high technology, such as infrared and video machinery, to provide long-range, 360-degree, all-weather surveillance along the border. The proposed layout and size of the IFTs is said to range between 120 and 180 feet high, with each tower having its own equipment such as generators, propane tanks, and equipment shelters. The lot size of each tower varies between 2,500 square feet and 25,600 square feet, plus a fence that encompasses up to 10,000 feet. The radio technology of the tower permits the machine to be able to detect movement as far as from a 9.3-mile radius and vehicles from an 18.6 mile radius, while the long-range camera allows for video footage from 13.5 miles away.\n\nIn March 2014, in efforts to raise border security, the United States Customs and Border Protection contracted a project with Elbit Systems of America to design and manufacture Integrated Fixed Towers (IFTs) along the Arizona border. The competition for a $145 million contract lasted between major defense contractors such as General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin, and Raytheon. This contract gave Elbit jurisdiction to implement these structures at an unknown number of sites at anonymous locations and the power for both the company and Border Patrol to deeply monitor the border. Originally, it was said that 16 IFTs would be placed along the southern border of Mexico and western border of the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument. An article published in March 2018 revealed that there are 52 IFTs in place along Arizona's southern border.\n\nBefore the implementation of IFTs, the government had been using SBInets. These machines were intended to serve the same purpose as the towers, while also allowing Border Patrol agents to observe information from a common operational picture. But the technology and functionality of SBInets did not meet expectations and costs began to exceed the budget by $1.4 billion. This led to a shift toward IFTs.\n\nThe implementation of these towers will aid Border Patrol in monitoring illegal crossings and suspicious activity that occurs near the border. Although the towers would benefit Border Patrol in controlling illegal activities, for the Tohono Oʼodham nation, the integration of these structures will result in further territorial disputes and invasion of privacy. The rapidly increasing surveillance and security in the borderlands has instilled fear within Indigenous communities. IFTs have begun to interfere with the Tohono Oʼodham's spiritual rituals and daily routines. Tribes such as the Tohono Oʼodham are no longer free to cross the border to visit their families or explore outside their homes without risking scrutiny by agents. Even with set boundaries and size guidelines for the towers, the IFTs have exceeded the established range and are beginning to occupy parts of Oʼodham territory. Moreover, the growing number of towers has brought increased numbers of Border Patrol agents: 1,500 positioned in three districts that control the reservation.\n\nAdministration\nThe Nation is organized into 11 local districts. Nine districts are on the Tohono Oʼodham Indian Reservation with the Gila Bend and San Xavier reservations, which are separated from the main reserve, making up the other two.\n\nThe Tohono Oʼodham Nation's government has three branches: executive, judicial, and legislative. The executive includes the chairmen and vice chairmen of the 11 districts, the judicial comprises the judges and courts, and the legislative consists of tribal council representatives from each administrative district. As a whole, the Tohono Oʼodham Nation is governed by a democratically elected chairperson and legislative council. All the reservations are overseen administratively by a central government in Sells. As of 2023, the Nation's chair is Verlon Jose and the vice chair is Carla Johnson. The chief justice is Violet Lui-Frank, and the legislative chair is Timothy Joaquin Gu Achi.\n\nThe Tohono Oʼodham Nation operates its own educational system, which includes Tohono Oʼodham Community College, a fire department, several recreation centers, a health center, a nursing home, and a public utilities company.\n\nEconomy\nEconomic support for the tribe comes from a variety of sources. Some Tohono Oʼodham still farm or engage in subsistence ranching. The tribe sells and leases copper mineral rights. The four casinos the tribe operates have become its major source of revenue and jobs. The tribe operates the Tohono Oʼodham Utility Authority, a tribal firm established in 1970 to provide electric and water service to the reservation. Basket weaving remains an economic pursuit; the tribe produces more basketry than any other tribe in the United States.",

He is best known for his roles as J.A.R.V.I.S. and Vision in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, including the Disney+ series WandaVision (2021), which garnered him a Primetime Emmy Award nomination.\n\nBettany first gained popularity for appearing in the films Gangster No. 1 (2000), A Knight's Tale (2001) and A Beautiful Mind (2001). He was nominated for a BAFTA Award for playing Stephen Maturin in the film Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World (2003). He also featured in Dogville (2003), Wimbledon (2004), The Da Vinci Code (2006), The Tourist (2010), Margin Call (2011), Legend (2015) and Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018). He made his directorial debut with the film Shelter (2014), which he also wrote and co-produced.\n\nIn television, Bettany has portrayed Ian Campbell, 11th Duke of Argyll in the series A Very British Scandal (2021) and on stage, he played Andy Warhol in the play The Collaboration (2022) in the West End and  Broadway.\n\nEarly life\nBettany was born on 27 May 1971 in London, to Anne (), a stage singer, theatre teacher, and stage manager, and Thane Bettany, a dancer, actor, drama teacher and godfather to Sophie, Duchess of Edinburgh.Biography of Paul Bettany  Bettany was raised Roman Catholic, although his church attendance drifted after his confirmation. Bettany then experimented with other Christian denominations among them Methodist and Church of England congregations with his father, before becoming an atheist. While his father taught at the all-girls boarding school Queenswood School, near Hatfield, Hertfordshire, the family lived on the school grounds.\n\nWhen Bettany was 16, his brother Matthew died at age 8 after falling onto concrete from a tennis pavilion roof at Queenswood. Soon after, Bettany dropped out of school, left home, and became a street performer in London. He lived in a small flat and earned money by playing his guitar in the streets as a busker. His parents later divorced. After two years, he found a new job in a home for the elderly. After working there for a year, Bettany enrolled at the Drama Centre London.\n\nCareer\nIn 1990, at the age of 19, Bettany began a three-year course at the Drama Centre London in Chalk Farm. He made his stage debut in Stephen Daldry's acclaimed West End revival of An Inspector Calls at the Aldwych Theatre, playing the part of Eric Birling. He also appeared in the Royal Shakespeare Company's productions of Richard III, Romeo and Juliet, and Julius Caesar (for which he received a Charleson Award nomination). When Bettany was 21, he appeared in a BBC production of Oliver Twist, playing Bill Sikes.\n\nAfter appearing in the finale of Sean Bean's series Sharpe as William II of the Netherlands at the Battle of Waterloo, he made his film debut with a small part in Bent, a Holocaust drama which also featured Clive Owen, Jude Law, and Ian McKellen. He continued doing work in stage and television: these included Joe Penhall's Love and Understanding, which played at London's Bush Theatre and then ran in Connecticut. He had roles in the television productions Killer Net and Coming Home, during which he met and dated Emily Mortimer. His last stage work was in One More Wasted Year and Stranger's House at the Royal Court Theatre. He filmed several more movies, including his first leading role in Gangster No. 1. The British Independent Film Awards nominated him for Best Actor, and the London Film Critics' Circle nominated him for British Newcomer of the Year. \n\nBack in Hollywood, writer/director Brian Helgeland (L.A. Confidential) was planning a new film called The Sin Eater (also known as The Order). He was impressed by Bettany's audition tape, though Helgeland eventually decided to film A Knight's Tale instead. The studio executives were not impressed, but Helgeland was determined to cast him, even writing the part of Chaucer for him. A Knight's Tale would be Bettany's first big Hollywood production. He received critical acclaim for A Knight's Tale, including winning the London Film Critics Circle Award for Best British Supporting Actor. After the movie wrapped, Helgeland, determined that Hollywood should recognise Bettany's talent, showed the audition tape to many of his peers, including Ron Howard, who promptly cast Bettany in A Beautiful Mind alongside Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly. After A Beautiful Mind, Bettany was offered the role of serial killer Francis Dolarhyde in Red Dragon, opposite Edward Norton and Anthony Hopkins. He turned down the role due to his commitment to a role in Lars von Trier's Dogville.\n\nBettany's next major project saw him starring again alongside A Beautiful Mind costar Russell Crowe in Peter Weir's Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World. His portrayal of surgeon and naturalist Stephen Maturin brought him a BAFTA nomination, and he was named British Actor of the Year (London Film Critics' Circle), and Best Actor (Evening Standard).\n\nOn 28 June 2004, Bettany and 13 other actors were included in the 2004 invitation to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Dogville and The Reckoning were released in limited cinemas in 2004. In September of that year, Bettany made his leading-man debut in Wimbledon, a romantic comedy with Kirsten Dunst. The film's cast would also introduce him to Jon Favreau, playing his manager, a relationship that would return when Favreau cast him as the voice of J.A.R.V.I.S. in Iron Man. In mid-2005, Bettany filmed Firewall in Vancouver, Canada, a thriller also starring Harrison Ford and Virginia Madsen, which reunited him with Wimbledon director Richard Loncraine. He spent the autumn of 2005 filming The Da Vinci Code, based on Dan Brown's best-selling novel and starring Tom Hanks, Audrey Tautou and Ian McKellen. In the film, he played an Opus Dei monk named Silas.\n\nIn 2007, Bettany went to London to star in There For Me, written by his friends Dan Fredenburgh and Doraly Rosen. In 2008, he appeared in the New Line Cinema family fantasy Inkheart, playing the part of a fire-eater named Dustfinger. In 2009, he appeared as Charles Darwin in Creation, starring opposite his own wife Jennifer Connelly. In 2010, Bettany appeared alongside Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie in The Tourist and portrayed the archangel Michael in Legion, a film depicting divine vengeance upon humanity. He starred in the films Priest and Margin Call, both released in 2011.\n\nBettany reprised his voice role as J.A.R.V.I.S. in 2010's Iron Man 2, 2012's The Avengers, 2013's Iron Man 3, and Disneyland's Innoventions attraction. In 2014, Bettany starred alongside Johnny Depp and fellow British actor Rebecca Hall in the feature film Transcendence. He was once again paired with Depp in Mortdecai, a 2015 motion picture also starring Gwyneth Paltrow and Ewan McGregor. After voicing J.A.R.V.I.S. for five years, Bettany made his first onscreen appearance in a Marvel Cinematic Universe film in the 2015 film Avengers: Age of Ultron, playing Vision. He reprised the role in the sequels Captain America: Civil War (2016) and Avengers: Infinity War (2018).\n\nBettany portrayed Ted Kaczynski in the Discovery Channel television show Manhunt: Unabomber. Bettany replaced Michael K. Williams in Solo: A Star Wars Story, after Williams was removed from the final film, as he was unable to return to set during the film's reshoots. Bettany was cast in his place, with the character being reworked from a motion-capture alien to a human. On 20 January 2018, it was reported that Bettany was nearing a deal to play Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh in the Netflix series The Crown, succeeding Matt Smith. Days later, on 25 January, it was reported by TVLine that Bettany was ultimately unable to sign on due to scheduling conflicts.\n\nBettany starred alongside Elizabeth Olsen in the Marvel television miniseries WandaVision, portraying a new version of his Marvel Cinematic Universe character, Vision, with Olsen portraying the titular Wanda. It premiered on Disney+ in January 2021, garnering praise from critics. Reviewing the series, Matt Purslow of IGN wrote Bettany \"effortlessly takes to the comedic skits\" and that he and Olsen \"provide a fantastic amount of life, wit, and emotion\". For his performance, Bettany received nominations for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie and Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Miniseries or Television Film.\n\nBettany starred in the 2021 miniseries A Very British Scandal. He played artist Andy Warhol in a production of the play The Collaboration by Anthony McCarten at the Young Vic in London from February to April 2022. He is slated to reprise the role in a film adaptation of the play. Bettany is attached to portray businessman Alexander Nix in a film about the Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal as well as co-write and star in the dramedy film Harvest Moon.\n\nBettany will reprise his role as Vision in the upcoming Disney+ series Vision Quest (2026).\n\nPersonal life\nOn 1 January 2003, Bettany married American actress Jennifer Connelly in Scotland, whom he met when they starred together in the 2001 film A Beautiful Mind. As a teenager, he had developed a crush on her after seeing her in the 1986 film Labyrinth. The September 11 attacks motivated him to act on his feelings for her, and after two days of attempting to contact her, he proposed, despite the fact that they were not yet in a relationship. Soon after their marriage, they moved to Brooklyn Heights after living in Tribeca.David, Amrk. \"Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly On the Move Again\" , Variety (magazine), 14 January 2012. Retrieved 25 February 2019. \"It was only about 3.5 years ago that English-born movie actor Paul Bettany (A Beautiful Mind, The Da Vinci Code, A Knight's Tale) and Brooklyn-bred Academy Award winner Jennifer Connelly (A Beautiful Mind, Requiem For A Dream, Blood Diamond) paid $6,920,000 for a full floor loft-type penthouse apartment on the edge of New York City's star-stocked TriBeCa neighborhood.\" The couple have two children together. Bettany is stepfather to Connelly's son from a previous relationship.\n\nBettany is a close friend of actor Johnny Depp since 2010 as they met on the set of The Tourist. Text messages between Bettany and Depp from 2013 were used as evidence in 2020 during Depp's defamation trial against The Sun and in 2022 as part of Depp's defamation trial against his ex-wife, actress Amber Heard.\n\nActing credits\nFilm\n\n Year Title Role Notes 1997 Bent Captain  1998 The Land Girls Philip  1999 After the Rain Steph Oosthuizen 2000 The Suicide Club Shaw Kiss Kiss (Bang Bang) Jimmy Dead Babies Quentin  Gangster No. 1 Young Gangster 2001 A Knight's Tale Geoffrey Chaucer A Beautiful Mind Charles Herman  2002 The Heart of Me Rickie 2003 Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World Dr. Stephen Maturin Dogville Tom Edison  2004 The Reckoning Nicholas Wimbledon Peter Colt 2005 Stories of Lost Souls\n| Y\n| Segment: \"Euston Road\"\n|-\n| rowspan=2 | 2006\n| Firewall| Bill Cox\n| \n|-\n| The Da Vinci Code| Silas\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" | 2008\n| Iron Man| J.A.R.V.I.S.\n| Voice\n|-\n| Broken Lines| Chester\n|\n|-\n| The Secret Life of Bees| T.

    "title": "Bree Van de Kamp",
    "clean_text": "Bree Van de Kamp  is a fictional character on the ABC television series Desperate Housewives. She was played by actress Marcia Cross, who received multiple awards and nominations for her portrayal, including an Emmy Award nomination, three Golden Globe Award nominations, and two Screen Actors Guild Awards. Cross' portrayal of Bree was widely praised by critics and fans.\n\nCross auditioned for the role of Mary Alice Young, but series creator Marc Cherry thought she was better suited for the role of Bree. Dana Delany, who was eventually cast as Katherine Mayfair, was chosen for the role but turned it down, saying it was too similar to her role in Pasadena.\n\nBree Van de Kamp is one of the four main protagonists in Desperate Housewives. Bree's main struggle throughout the series was her attempts to maintain a perfect life despite various obstacles such as widowhood, divorce, and alcoholism hindering her. She married Rex Van de Kamp (Steven Culp), Orson Hodge (Kyle MacLachlan), and Trip Weston (Scott Bakula) and had relationships with various other men.\n\nCharacter profile\nBree Mason grew up in Rhode Island when her father married a woman named Eleanor, after her mother's death, with whom she did not get along. In order to escape her stepmother's demands, Bree left for Lake Forest College near Chicago. Bree also mentioned on one of Eleanor's visits that she had to work for every kind word she was  ever given by her stepmother. Bree met Rex Van de Kamp at a meeting of the Young Republicans. After they graduated, they married and had two children, Andrew and Danielle, and moved to Fairview.\n\nBree was very much written as an exaggerated version of the characteristics often attributed to White Anglo-Saxon Protestants; she has been called a \"hyper-uptight WASP\". Bree is recognized for her perfectionistic attitude and work ethic, which at times bordered on neurosis. Her perfectionism may stem from when her mother was killed in a hit-and-run; a 10-year-old Bree cleaned her blood off the road outside the house. She said that once everything was spotless, she felt much better.\n\nBree is known for her homemaking talents at the level of Martha Stewart, particularly her gourmet meals, breakfast treats, and pineapple bran muffins. She's also well versed in firearms; she owns 4 guns and is a card-carrying member of the National Rifle Association. Bree supports the Republican Party, as stated in the season 3 opener, and was also known for being a member of the local Presbyterian church, as seen in the episode, Sunday. Her neighbors, Angie Bolen, Gabrielle Solis, and Renee Perry, nicknamed her \"Nancy Reagan\" on occasions.\n\nBree lived at 4354 Wisteria Lane in Fairview since 1994 and was also said to have a timeshare residence in Aspen that she never uses. Bree is based on creator Marc Cherry's own mother, and the Van de Kamp family is based on the family in which he grew up. Bree's family was based on Marc Cherry's teen years, while Lynette Scavo's family was based on Marc Cherry's childhood years. Bree and her first husband, Rex, were both named after the overtly vain characters on two of Marc Cherry's previous failed sitcoms, The 5 Mrs. Buchanans (Bree) and The Crew (Rex).\n\nBoth of Bree's marriages broke down and ended in divorce (however, Rex died before their divorce was finalized); following their requests for divorce, both of Bree's former husbands attempted reconciliation with her. Rex succeeded, whereas her second husband, Orson Hodge, did not. During the breakdown of her second marriage, Bree had an affair with Karl Mayer, her divorce lawyer and the ex-husband of her friend, Susan Mayer. However, Bree did remarry in the series finale to her lawyer, Trip Weston, making him her third husband.\n\nBree is the only one of the main four housewives to not appear in every episode. Appearing only as a stand-in in \"My Husband, The Pig\", Bree is totally absent in its six following episodes (\"Dress Big\", \"Liaisons\", \"God, That's Good\", \"Gossip\", \"Into the Woods\", and \"What Would We Do Without You?\") due to Cross' pregnancy.\n\nStorylines\nBackstory\nBree MasonSeason 1 episode 2Season 2 episode 19 was born in 1962.Mike and his map, when he wrote \"Bree (42 [years old]) in s01e02\" When she was 10 years old, her mother taught her a lesson about \"masking\" so she could hide true feelings and emotions, which prevented her from being able to be hurt by men.Season 8 episode 17 During Christmas 1972, her mother died in hospital after a car accident. Bree stayed at home and cleaned her mother's blood from the driveway. She felt relieved after that.Season 1 episode 5 Her father then married Eleanor (Carol Burnett). Bree had to earn respect from her stepmother and so worked very hard. Eleanor said to her stepdaughter that she was very lucky and possessed beauty, wit, cunning, and insight: weapons all women needed to survive in the world.Season 2 episode 14 Her dad took care of his daughter and tried to raise her to be a classy lady.Season 8 episode 11\n\nBree was first engaged to her boyfriend, Ty Grant, but after she met Rex Van de Kamp, the two fell in love during their college years. Bree and Rex got married in 1987.Season 2 episode 3 Bree gave birth to their son Andrew in 1988 and daughter Danielle in 1989. The family moved in 1994 to 4354 Wisteria Lane, Fairview. She gave a bad first impression to Mary Alice Young and Susan Mayer, local neighbors and friends, after Andrew stole a ceramic frog from the Youngs' backyard. Bree, Susan, and Mary Alice later become close friends. In 1998, Lynette Scavo joined the group.Season 2 episode 24 Five years later, after a short and difficult first impression of Gabrielle Solis,Season 5 episode 13 all four women accepted the ex-model as their friend.\n\nSeason 1\nBree is introduced as the \"perfect\" wife and mother. However, it becomes apparent that her emotional coldness and obsession with appearances makes her family resent her, and as her husband Rex puts it, \"I just can't live in this detergent commercial anymore\".\n\nShe insists she and Rex have marriage guidance counseling with Dr. Albert Goldfine (Sam Lloyd) when he wants a divorce and demands that Andrew and Danielle refuse presents from their father if they want to continue living with her. Unfortunately, in Andrew's case, this leads to him driving drunk and accidentally running over Carlos Solis's mother, leaving her in a coma. Rex and Bree conceal this to protect him but Bree is soon disappointed with his lack of remorse. Determined to make him realize that there are consequences to his actions, she gets him kicked off the swimming team by reporting marijuana he had hidden in his swim locker and then anonymously tipping off his coach.\n\nBree is determined to keep her family together until Rex has a heart attack, leading her to discover that he regularly visits a prostitute. Worse still, the prostitute turns out to be an acquaintance of hers, Maisy Gibbons (Sharon Lawrence), who is later arrested for living off of immoral earnings. Maisy is persuaded to cut a plea deal with the district attorney, naming her clients, and despite a request from Bree, Maisy does not remove Rex's name. Furious, Bree tells Rex she will divorce him but is \"persuaded\" by Andrew and Danielle to look after him while he recuperates. Initially wanting to hurt him, Bree starts dating their pharmacist, George Williams (Roger Bart), but ends things when Rex asks her to give their marriage another chance. She and George agree to be just friends. Wanting to deter Rex from visiting prostitutes, she reluctantly takes part in S&M scenarios with him.\n\nConcerned about Andrew's worsening behavior, she is cheered up when Rex backs her up on one occasion. Unfortunately, this fails to make any difference, so Rex and Bree feel that they have no choice but to send Andrew away to a boot camp. While there, Andrew reveals to his parents that he is gay. Bree initially tells him that she will always love him regardless but quietly insists to Rex that they take Andrew home immediately, worried about what he might be doing with the other boys at night, and asks their vicar to give Andrew some counseling on lifestyle, believing that his soul is in danger. This has disastrous results, as Andrew thinks she doesn't love him and deliberately hurts her. Bree continues to confide in George about her family problems but, after Rex makes it clear that Bree will stay with him, George begins tampering with Rex's medication. This is uncovered when Rex has a second heart attack. Believing Bree was responsible, Rex writes a note forgiving her and dies. Bree's final scenes in the season involve her receiving the bad news and breaking down in tears.\n\nSeason 2\nBree's mother-in-law, Phyllis (Shirley Knight), visits for her son's funeral. She annoys Bree with her constant sniping and excessive displays of grief to the point that Bree refuses to let her attend Rex's funeral, but Andrew persuades her to. The final straw, however, is when she discovers that Phyllis has reported her friendship with George to Rex's life insurance provider. Bree sends Phyllis home and is questioned by the police about meddling with Rex's medication. She is cleared and is furious when she discovers the note Rex had left her which claimed he thought she murdered him, and she starts dating George. However, George constantly tries to rush things, making her uneasy. When George places an announcement of their engagement in the newspaper, an ex-fiancée of his, Leila Mitzman, visits Bree to warn her about him. Bree is horrified and sends Leila away, but she is proved right when George loses his temper upon seeing Bree dance with Ty Grant, and she also finds out that he threw Dr. Goldfine over the side of a bridge for suggesting to Bree that she take their relationship slowly. George tries blackmailing her into a reconciliation by taking some pills and admits to killing Rex. Devastated, Bree says that she has called an ambulance and it will be there soon, but in reality, she hasn't. She watches him die and tells Andrew, who tries blackmailing her for his trust fund.\n \nEvents with Rex, George, and Andrew take their toll and she starts drinking heavily. She realizes she has a problem when she loses Lynette's children after passing out while babysitting. Andrew later begins making accusations about Bree physically abusing him and tries to seek emancipation rights, which Bree refuses. In denial, but not wanting Andrew to get his trust fund or give up on him, Bree joins Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) but only takes it seriously after passing out in a shop changing room and not waking up until late at night. Her AA sponsor, Peter McMillan (Lee Tergesen), and a security guard let her out. Bree also faces more turmoil when she discovers her new neighbors, the Applewhites, are hiding from the police and she is blackmailed into silence. To distract herself from her alcoholism, she has a brief relationship with Peter, who is addicted to sex. However, Andrew discovers this and seduces Peter to get revenge on Bree for denying him his trust fund. She dumps Peter and throws Andrew out after discovering that they slept together and in her bed.\n\nBree's mental health deteriorates rapidly following this and nobody can help her as her behavior becomes erratic and spirals out of control, including creating a scene at Danielle's birthday party. Danielle, meanwhile, starts dating Matthew Applewhite and moves out to be with him. However, Matthew's mother, Betty Applewhite, realizes Matthew murdered an ex-girlfriend, Melanie Foster, but made her believe his brother did it. Betty tells Bree, who has checked herself into a psychiatric unit and later escapes after they refuse to let her leave. Bree and Betty rush to Bree's house to find Matthew and Danielle have taken money from Bree's safe. Bree confronts Matthew about Melanie and refuses to let them leave, so he threatens to shoot her, only to be shot dead by a police sniper. Bree's final scenes involve her beginning a new friendship with the mysterious Orson Hodge.\n\nSeason 3\nAfter a six-month relationship, Bree marries Orson, but their marriage is troubled by the belief that Orson physically abused his first wife, Alma (Valerie Mahaffey), and murdered her. She becomes overwhelmed with guilt to see Andrew on TV, reduced to living on the streets, and tracks him down only to be rebuffed. Shortly after the wedding, Orson persuades Andrew to come home and they reconcile.\n\nHowever, the arrival of Orson's mother, Gloria (Dixie Carter), and Alma's return cause more trouble. They drug and rape Orson but Bree intervenes, learning that Gloria murdered Orson's mistress, Monique Polier, so he would stay with Alma. Gloria tries to kill Bree but Orson intervenes. Gloria has a severe stroke after Orson holds her head under water to get her to let go of the knife with which she is trying to kill Bree. Orson carries Gloria's body outside and places it next to Alma's body — Alma having died when she fell off the roof of her house while trying to escape to warn Bree about Gloria.\n\nDanielle, meanwhile, finds herself pregnant by Edie Britt's nephew Austin McCann (Josh Henderson). She is sent away so the neighborhood won't learn of her pregnancy and Bree and Orson decide to fake a pregnancy so they can raise Danielle's child as their own.\n\nBree is not in episodes 3.16 to 3.22 as she is on honeymoon with Orson and Danielle. Bree returns for Gabrielle and Victor's wedding, heavily pregnant, or so it seems...\n\nSeason 4\nBree and Orson struggle to make people think she is pregnant but is dismayed by people wanting to feel the baby move. Phyllis discovers Bree's pregnancy hoax and tries convincing Danielle to raise the child herself. Bree and Orson, however, persuade Danielle to give them the baby by offering to send her to college and buy her a convertible. Danielle has a baby boy and gives him to Bree — who names him Benjamin Tyson Hodge (surname later changed to Katz) — and agrees that Bree and Orson will raise him.\n\nBree develops a rivalry with new neighbor, Katherine Mayfair (Dana Delany). Bree and Katherine are very similar, leading to a series of feuds before eventually becoming friends and going into business together, catering dinner parties.\n\nAfter a tornado damages Bree's house, she, Orson, and Benjamin stay with Susan and Mike Delfino. During this time, Orson begins sleepwalking, twice being caught naked by Susan. Things come to a head when Julie catches him confessing to running over Mike. While Mike and Susan are willing to forgive Orson for his crime, Bree is horrified and kicks him out. During their separation, Edie Britt comes onto Orson, leading to a feud between her and Bree. Edie discovers Benjamin is Bree's grandson and attempts to blackmail her. Bree, however, tells the other housewives the truth, so they all snub Edie.\n\nIn the season finale, Katherine saves Bree's life by telling her ex-husband, Wayne Davis (Gary Cole), her secrets. When Katherine kills Wayne, Bree and the other housewives tell the police that Katherine was terrified of a stalker so that she doesn't go to prison.\n\nWhen the events of the series shift ahead by five years in the fourth-season finale, it is revealed that Bree is now a famous cookbook author, and Andrew works with her as her assistant. Bree and Orson have evidently worked out their problems and are still together.\n\nSeason 5\nBree has just published her own cookbook, and is successfully running the catering business. She and Orson reconcile after he went to prison for running over Mike. A flashback sequence reveals that while Bree awaited Orson's release, Danielle returned and took Benjamin, leaving her completely alone. Devastated, Bree relapsed into alcoholism but overcame it, thanks to Katherine.\n\nBree puts her career first, alienating her friends at times and causing a rift between her and Orson. As revenge, Orson begins stealing, initially to punish people who he feels have been rude and to hurt Bree. Orson agrees to stop stealing, but when he is injured while attempting to rob an old woman (and indirectly causes Edie's death when she crashes her car into a telephone pole trying to avoid him) and tries to convince people that the old woman is senile, she decides she has had enough. She hires Karl Mayer as her divorce lawyer, who helps her stage a fake burglary so she can hide her preciously expensive assets in a storage unit and not risk losing them in the divorce proceedings. However, Orson discovers her plan, threatening to send her to prison for insurance fraud unless she stays with him. Bree agrees reluctantly but shares a passionate kiss with Karl.\n\nSeason 6\nInitially, Bree is unwilling to sleep with Karl, despite her marriage being strained.  Orson, however, is determined to salvage their marriage, commenting that guilt is sometimes necessary for happiness, and defending his use of blackmail so that she'll stay with him. Bree takes this motto as her own and consummates her affair with Karl.\n\nWhen Julie is hospitalized after being attacked, Bree worries that she will lose Susan's friendship upon hearing that Susan would hypothetically no longer talk to a friend who dated Karl. However, Karl's fragility convinces Bree he needs her and she begins falling for him, acknowledging her feelings when they attend the same event and Karl brings another woman. This distracts her from her business, causing her to only realize the extent of Katherine's instability when an event is ruined. Bree dismisses her and, after getting to know new neighbor Angie Bolen (Drea de Matteo), hires her instead. Meanwhile, Karl's romantic gestures make their affair harder to hide. Suspicious, Orson gets Angie to spy on Bree. Angie discovers the affair, and helps Bree hide Karl when Orson comes home early and attempts to catch them in the act, but afterwards challenges Bree about her feelings for these two men. As Bree sees it, she connects intellectually with Orson but sexually with Karl, and is worried that their relationship will only ever be physical, despite his promises to change.\n\nBree's fears are realized when Susan catches her and Karl together at a motel. They fight, but despite her initial unhappiness, Susan eventually gives them her blessing. In order to get away from Orson, Karl suggests Bree threaten him, which she does by hiring an ex-con Orson met in prison to meet with him, and capturing the meeting on a hidden camera. She takes the pictures to Orson, which serve as proof of him breaking his parole, and demands a divorce. Stunned, Orson reveals that he had been bluffing when he threatened to turn her in for the insurance fraud, and goes to pack, but discovers her affair with Karl when Karl confesses to him at the annual Wisteria Lane Christmas block party, in part due to the fact that he'd hired a plane to fly a banner over the party with a message asking Bree to marry him.  A fight breaks out between the two men, and Bree tries intervening, to no success. The fight is ended when the pilot of the banner plane suffers a fatal heart attack at the controls and the plane subsequently crashes into the party, killing Karl and leaving Orson paralyzed.\n\nFeeling guilty, Bree insists Orson come home so she can look after him but he is disgusted by her infidelity and takes advantage. Angry about his lack of manners and personal hygiene, Bree hoses him down but stops when he explains how angry he is with the way his life is now. Wanting to help, Bree gets two disabled men to visit, but Orson asks her to let him kill himself, telling her that he wants to die because no one loves him. When asked, Bree can't say the words, but seeing Orson trying to drown himself at a party of an old married couple with such passion causes Bree to realize that she still wants things to work with Orson. She stops him by telling him how much she cares and wants to recapture what they once had, and they reconcile.\n\nA young man named Sam Allen (Samuel Page) visits Bree, offering himself as a new assistant. Impressed by Sam's skills, Bree promotes him to vice-president, much to Andrew's anger. While visiting Sam's home, Bree is stunned to learn that Sam is a son that Rex had from a relationship he had prior to meeting Bree. Sam admits that he's spent years watching Bree's family, wondering why Rex chose them over him, and after his mother's death, came to see Bree. Shocked by this, Bree welcomes Sam into her life but finds herself at odds with Andrew, who suspects Sam has an ulterior motive. Sam plots to make Bree fire Andrew, which she does, but after she reveals that she and Andrew have a love-and-hate relationship, it's likely that Andrew will return. After she tells Orson about a sabotaged dinner, suspecting Andrew, Orson points out that Andrew couldn't be responsible because it was well planned, making Bree suspect Sam's true intentions. She discovers that Sam's mother is still alive and reveals that Sam found a letter from Rex, offering to take full custody of him. Bree confronts Sam about his lies and he angrily smashes a vase before leaving. She apologizes to Andrew but tells him and Orson she's not firing Sam for fear of how he might react.\n\nIn the season finale, Bree does try firing Sam but he retaliates by revealing he's found out about Andrew's hit-and-run years before (a drunken Danielle told him). He threatens to tell the police unless Bree turns over control of the company to him. Bree reluctantly agrees to do so, while telling Sam she feels sorry for him losing his chance to be part of a family and suspects no one will ever truly care for him. Orson, who had not known what Andrew did, calls out Bree on the hypocrisy of demanding he go to jail for running Mike over but hiding Andrew's crime. He is both appalled and furious at Bree for this and announces he's moving out. Bree tells Andrew she now knows Orson was right and is seen about to confess to Gabrielle.\n\nSeason 7\nBree confesses to covering up the demise of Carlos' mother. Gabrielle chooses not to tell her husband. After discovering her ex-husband has a new girlfriend only a week after they separated, Bree decides to redecorate the ground floor of her house, hiring Keith Watson (Brian Austin Green) to help, but finds herself attracted to him. While looking at him from her car, she does not see Juanita Solis (Madison De La Garza) behind her before reversing, leading to Juanita being admitted to the hospital. Upon finding out that Keith has a girlfriend, she agrees to go out clubbing with Renee Perry. She finds out that Keith broke up with his girlfriend, but he is instead going home with Renee. Bree sabotages their night and eventually asks Keith on a date. This begins Bree and Renee's fight over Keith.\n\nLater, Bree only mentions to Keith's father Richard that she's finally a divorcee. Learning this, Richard, who has been having feelings for Bree, tries to make a move to destroy Bree's and Keith's relationship so that he can have Bree instead. Keith attempts to propose to Bree and after the second failed attempt, Keith begins to question his relationship with Bree. Richard manipulates Keith's mind by warning him that Bree might be using him as a diversion from her actual feelings after her divorce from Orson. As a result, Keith begins to avoid Bree. Richard then abruptly kisses Bree, and after he leaves, Bree tells Keith everything about his father's attempts to tear them apart. Later, Keith confronts Richard about this and has a fistfight with him but when rioters, who are opposing Paul Young's plan to open a halfway house for ex-convicts on Wisteria Lane, see the two fight, they mistake Keith for an ex-convict due to his tattoos and ex-convict-like clothing and begin to attack him. Bree breaks up the fight by firing a gun into the air. This triggers fear and panic among the rioters and supporters for the halfway house alike, thinking this is an assassination attempt, culminating in a human stampede that spirals out of control.\n\nBree is thrown when Orson returns, claiming he was dumped by his girlfriend. Keith is annoyed at how Bree is willing to let Orson stay with them. Over dinner, Orson makes it clear he doesn't think Keith is a good choice for Bree as they have nothing in common and Orson understands her more, with the two even resorting to throwing food at one another. Bree goes to see Orson's ex, who reveals that Orson was the one who broke up with her as he's still in love with Bree. She confronts him and Orson confesses how he feels and thinks Bree is too good for Keith. Keith is angered at Bree continuing to want Orson to stay with them, saying that she's still in love with Orson. Bree responds by shoving him down in her manure-covered lawn, getting herself dirty, to prove how much she's changed. When one of Keith's old girlfriends comes by, Bree is suspicious and discovers the woman has been raising Keith's son. She mentions children to Keith, who seems unsure whether he is father material. Bree goes to the girlfriend, lying about how Keith doesn't want to know the child. Keith finds her cutting up her roses as she says \"you have to be ruthless to protect what you want\". Bree meets the woman later to lend her money and when she leaves her son in Bree's care, Keith drops by the pizza parlor. Seeing Keith and the boy instantly bonding, Bree is overcome with guilt and confesses to Keith that the boy is actually his son. Keith desperately wants to be with his son, but he doesn't want to leave Bree, so he pitches the idea of moving to Florida with Bree but she refuses to leave her home and friends. The next day Bree makes the ultimate decision and tells Keith that he must go to Florida for his son. She sacrifices their relationship and Keith leaves.\n\nBree discovers that Andrew has started drinking again, so much so that his husband leaves him. She encourages Andrew to go to rehab but is jarred when he decides to make amends by telling Carlos about running over his mother. When Carlos invites Andrew on a camping trip, Bree and Gabrielle fear the worst and follow them. Seeing Carlos with a bloody towel and a dirty shovel, Bree blurts out what Andrew did, just before her son enters the cabin. Carlos is outraged over this but eventually forgives Andrew. However, when Bree comes to thank him for not pressing charges, Carlos coldly tells her he won't forgive her for hiding the truth all these years, that they're no longer friends, and that she and Gabby can no longer be friends.  Bree ends up taking Gabby and her daughters into her house when Gabby leaves Carlos after telling him that she refuses to end her friendship with Bree.  While the Solises are staying with Bree, she has a run-in with Detective Chuck Vance (Jonathan Cake), who was on Wisteria Lane to check on parolee Felicia Tillman.  Juanita Solis calls the police and tells them that Bree is trying to kill her and Celia (after Carlos tells her about Bree's involvement in her grandmother's death). Chuck responds to the call at Bree's home and Carlos sorts everything out, explaining that the girls misunderstood what he had told them. Chuck leaves and gives Bree his number, and the Solises move out of Bree's and back with Carlos.\n\nChuck later returns to give Bree his number again after assuming she'd lost it since he hasn't received a call from her. Bree then agrees to go out on a date with him that night and when Bree tells this to Renee, Renee runs a background check on Chuck and reveals to Bree that he's still married (though he had filed for divorce a year ago). At dinner, Bree confronts Chuck with this information but Chuck retaliates by telling her that he had also run a background check on her, therefore becoming more aware of Bree's past. Offended, Bree abruptly ends their date and as Chuck drives her home, Chuck catches a hooker in the street and brings her back to her women's shelter. There, Chuck tells the hooker (who believes that she'll be a hooker forever) that she can turn her life around, pretending to reveal that Bree once was a prostitute and she had turned over a new leaf by going to school and starting a massive catering company. Moved by Chuck's sincere words, Bree gives Chuck a second chance and the two agree to go out on another date afterwards.\n\nDuring the \"progressive dinner party\" celebrating Susan's return to Wisteria Lane, Bree (along with Lynette and Susan) walks into Gaby's house to discover that Carlos has murdered Gaby's abusive stepfather Alejandro Perez. She spearheads the decision to cover up the murder to protect Carlos, thus earning his forgiveness for keeping the secret about his mother's hit-and-run for all those years.\n\nSeason 8\nFollowing their agreement to cover up the murder of Alejandro, Bree's relationship with Chuck begins to suffer. She finds herself constantly paranoid that he will discover her involvement and uses sex as a way to distract him. She then receives a note exactly like the one Mary Alice received when she shot herself. She then seeks out the counsel of Paul Young, asking if he was the one who sent it. Upset over the fact that Bree may still judge him for his past, he sends her away. However, he later calls her back, urging her to tell the other housewives to spare her Mary Alice's fate and reveals to her the only other person who he told about the note to was the cop who was looking into Martha Huber's death, Chuck. At first suspicious, Bree decides to break up with Chuck when he tries to propose. He does not take it well, telling her she is making a big mistake. Danielle returns, having been dumped by her husband, and Bree is at first supportive until she finds out her daughter is now selling adult swings to make money.\n\nHaving avoided church over her guilt in hiding Alejandro, Bree is convinced to help Ben Faulkner in cooking for a soup kitchen. When a passing college student raves over her cooking, the kitchen is soon home to regular people, not the homeless, and Bree realizes that she has wrongly prioritized her own culinary career over helping people. She tells everyone to leave, giving a speech on how the soup kitchen is meant to help the less fortunate. Ben is impressed and has Bree give a speech to the city council to convince them to let Ben build a homeless shelter in Fairview. Bree is initially happy about helping Ben until she realizes the spot Ben is about to break ground on is where the girls buried Alejandro. She, Gabrielle, and Lynette go to dig the body back up only to find it gone. It turns out Ben found it earlier, thinking he was just a drifter, and Bree convinces him to help keep it quiet. However, Bree soon finds Chuck is suspicious and putting together clues to prove what the girls did. The pressure soon drives Bree to break her sobriety and pour herself a drink.\n\nChuck starts to dig deeper into Gabrielle's stepfather's disappearance. Gabrielle tells Bree that Chuck brought them in for questioning and Bree snaps, causing her to head to a motel. When she arrives, she sits at a table in her room, pulls out a bottle of wine and a gun, and begins talking to the spirit of Mary Alice who has appeared sitting in front of her. Bree asks her if she is happy after having killed herself and Mary Alice replies, \"I'm not unhappy\". Bree is ready to kill herself when Renee kicks in the door, mistakenly believing Bree is with Ben. After yelling, threatening to hit her, and telling her she's \"nothing more than a skank in a Nancy Reagan nightie\", Renee notices the gun and the note. After reading it, she takes Bree home and stays there to make sure she's okay. When Renee says she won't let a friend die, Bree points out they're not quite friends, hurting Renee. She confesses to Bree how her own mother committed suicide and makes Bree see it's not the way out. Bree is happy at first, more so when she hears Chuck was killed in a hit-and-run. However, when she opens her mailbox, she finds a note saying \"You're welcome.\"\n\nRenee takes Bree to a bar, encouraging her to live a little, and Bree ends up going skinny dipping with a man she has just met in the pool of his opulent house, before the true owner of the house, his boss, catches them when he comes home. Bree is soon going to bed with a succession of men which gets the Reverend concerned about her behavior. Determined to show he's wrong, Bree participates in a bake sale where she meets one of her lovers, only to discover he's married. When Karen McCluskey says that they do not know what Bree is really like, Bree decides to live up to her reputation as the new town slut. Bree is soon bed hopping to the point that she hits on a man in a bar without remembering she had gone home with him just two nights previously. When they hear about Renee taking Bree to a bar, her friends try and stage an intervention, at which point Bree reaches her breaking point and blasts them for their less than friend-like behavior recently. At the bar, she's approached by a man and realizes how far she's fallen, ready to go home. The man follows her to the parking lot, threatening to assault Bree, only for them to be interrupted by a wheelchair-using Orson. He uses a taser to knock the man out, telling Bree her friends called him to help and if there's one thing they did well together, it was \"cleaning up each other's messes\". Orson soon convinces Bree that the girls are still angry at her and to go away with him for a weekend. What Bree doesn't know is that Orson has been stalking her for months, seeing the girls bury Alejandro's body, and he was the one leaving Bree the notes as part of his warped scheme to win her back. Bree soon discovers the truth while visiting Orson's apartment and despite his claims he did it all for her, she says she wants nothing to do with him. Orson calls her later, claiming that their love requires sacrifice, and Bree believes he's going to kill himself. Instead, Orson mails a folder of evidence against her to the police.\n\nBree is surprised when Andrew comes home, engaged to a woman named Mary Beth. Learning she's an heiress, Bree suspects Andrew is just marrying her for her money. Mary Beth tells Bree she knows Andrew is gay but is still willing to marry him as she's been unlucky in love. Bree convinces Mary Beth to find a man who truly loves her and she breaks up with Andrew. Andrew is upset at losing a chance at the money but Bree tells him he can stay with her and accept her help getting back on his feet.\n\nMeanwhile, the police become suspicious of Bree and the murder of Gaby's stepfather and the help in its cover-up, so they tread carefully in trying to get proof that she is one of the suspects. They interview her, and she says that she had nothing to do with it. However, having been interrogated while drinking a cup of tea, her fingerprints are left on the mug. The fingerprint that the police found on the body and the fingerprint on Bree's cup match. The police go and talk to Ben, still about the murder of Alejandro. Ben keeps Bree's secret, and the police leave, with no more evidence than the fingerprint. But they do not stop there; a detective tracks down a call from Bree to Ben that night regarding Alejandro's murder, and they record it.\n\nIn order to defend herself, Bree asks Bob Hunter for legal advice, but he tells her she needs a criminal lawyer. He recommends lawyer Trip Weston, whom he calls a \"shark\". Bree goes to trial but does not tell Trip all the truth and is about to go to prison until Mrs. McCluskey confesses to the murder of Alejandro herself, after Bree and the girls agree to take care of her during her last days of life. Bree is acquitted of all charges. In the end, Bree marries Trip and moves to Louisville, Kentucky, where she joins a club for conservative women. Later, she is encouraged by Trip to run for the city council and the following November, she is elected to the Kentucky Legislature.\n\nReception\n\nCritical\nBree has received wide acclaim, both for the character's storylines, and for Cross' portrayal. In a review of the pilot, Tim Goodman from the San Francisco Chronicle called Cross \"almost too perfect as uptight Bree\" and applauded her for \"managing to give the character more shadings than merely insanely perfect\".\n\nAt the commencement of the second season, Bree was widely considered the series' most prominent character, following the first year's emphasis on Susan Mayer. Though a drop in quality was noted in the second season, Bree's battles with alcohol, her teenage son, and her murderous pharmacist lover, while continuing to deal with the death of her husband, were well received and considered the focal point of the series in light of the lagging Applewhite mystery.\n\nCross retained her center-stage position for the show's third season, which widely focused upon the mystery surrounding her new husband Orson. Critics noted an improvement in quality from the second season to the third, and many deemed Bree's storyline to be the most satisfying of the season, as well as noting a \"loss of steam\" during Cross' maternity leave at the latter part of the season.\n\nSeason 4's \"fake pregnancy\" storyline continued to satisfy critics, with one calling it the series' most \"hysterical [storyline] yet\" and singling Cross out for praise. Her friction with Katherine Mayfair was also noted as a highlight. Following the five-year leap, a new direction was taken with Bree's character as she made the transition from housewife to author/businesswoman, a development which received positive reception.\n\nThis change in character development was continued into season 6, with another side to Bree's personality being shown, which includes an affair with Karl Mayer. Critics lauded the comic relief provided by these developments, as well as the more poignant and emotional turn mid-season as Bree deals with Orson's paralysis.\n\nIn Season 7, Bree finds herself newly divorced and embarks on a relationship with Keith Watson, a move which was praised for allowing \"the for-so-long uptight Bree letting her hair down and having some fun for a change.\" By the climax of season 7, Bree is central in covering up the murder of Gabrielle's stepfather, a move which was praised as a sound set-up for the final season.\n\nAwards\nMarcia Cross has received widespread acclaim for her portrayal of Bree. For her work on the second season of the show, she garnered the Satellite Award for Best Actress - Television Series Musical or Comedy (her second nomination) and also received the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series twice as part of the cast (being nominated a further three times).\n\nIn 2005, Cross was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series for her performance in the season one episode, \"Running to Stand Still\". She also made the Top 10 Pre-Nomination Finalist listing for the same award three subsequent times, for her work on the second-season episode \"Next\", third-season episode \"Listen to the Rain on the Roof\", and fourth-season episode \"Now You Know\". She received three nominations at the Golden Globe Awards, for Best Actress in a Television Series - Musical or Comedy, for her work on the first three seasons of the show and also received three nominations at the Prism Awards (for Performance in a Comedy Series, in relation to Bree's alcoholism) and a nomination from the Television Critics Association for Individual Achievement in Comedy in 2005.\n\nCultural influences and impact\nBree is spoofed in MADtv Desperate Housewives parody, in which they mock the character's plastic exterior and demeanor. In a 2006 interview with Charmed Magazine, Michelle Stafford admitted that her character Mandi in Charmed episode \"Desperate Housewitches\" was almost entirely modeled after Marcia Cross as Bree. Looking at pictures and episodes of Bree to gain a sense of her posture and body language, she laughed, \"I'm just mimicking her. I'm just ripping her off.\"\n\nIn 2007, Madame Alexander released a line of 16-inch fashion dolls of the series' main characters, including Bree.",

Results and statistics from this game did not count toward the season.\n\nGrinnell\n\nGrinnell had won four of the previous five Iowa state championships prior to their first game against Nebraska. A hard-fought first half ended scoreless, but the underdog Bugeaters used three second-half touchdowns by George Flippin to pull away.\n\nDoane\n\nDoane scored once in each half to upset the Bugeaters.\n\nAt Missouri\n\nNebraska's first conference game in 1894 was a trip to Missouri. The Tigers won 18–14.\n\nAt Omaha YMCA\n\nNebraska's first-ever football game was a tightly contested game against the Omaha YMCA, but by 1894 the Bugeaters outmatched the YMCA's team of high school students and other Omaha residents. Nebraska led 30–0 lead at halftime, and won the game 36–6.\n\nAt Kansas\n\nAn officiating dispute delayed kickoff, but once underway Kansas took an early 6–0 lead. The Bugeaters pulled ahead 8–6 by halftime and kept the Jayhawks off the scoreboard in the second half to win for the first time against Kansas.\n\nUniversity of Kansas records suggest this game was played on November 22, 1894 in Lincoln.\n\nAt Ottawa\n\nThough the game was planned just one week ahead of time, efforts were made to publicize the match, drawing over 400 locals from the area to watch. Nebraska padded its roster in preparation, adding head coach Frank Crawford as a quarterback and another (unnamed) football coach as a fullback. Nebraska's first half touchdown was the only scoring of the day. This was the only game ever played between Nebraska and Ottawa.\n\nIowa\n\nNebraska's final conference game was a trip to Omaha to meet Iowa. Nebraska, led by future Utah governor and United States Secretary of War George Dern, dominated the game en route to a 36–0 win. The win gave Nebraska a share of its first conference championship.\n\nUniversity of Iowa records suggest the final score of this game was a 14–12 Nebraska victory.\n\nAt Omaha YMCA\n\nAfter a dominating Nebraska victory just weeks prior, the Omaha YMCA nearly upset the Bugeaters in a Christmas Day rematch. The YMCA led 6–0 at halftime but Nebraska answered with 10 points in the second half to win.",

The clan were originally Kuni no miyatsuko but after the abolition of the role they took on a priestly role at Atsuta Shrine, they share this history with the Izumo clan of Izumo-taisha, the Aso clan of Aso Shrine, the  of Munakata Taisha, and the Yamato clan of Ōyamato Shrine.\n\nThe \"Daijingu engi\" records show that during Emperor Temmu's time, the divine sword was returned to the palace. Seven guardians were then appointed to oversee its worship. These guardians were linked to Miyazu-hime and Takeinatane.\n\nAccording to traditional sources, Yamato Takeru died in the 43rd year of Emperor Keiko's reign (景行天皇43年, equivalent 113 AD).Ponsonby-Fane, p. 433.  The possessions of the dead prince were gathered together along with the sword Kusanagi; and his widow Miyazu-hime venerated his memory in a shrine at her home.  Sometime later, these relics and the sacred sword were moved to the current location of the Atsuta Shrine.Ponsonby-Fane, p. 434.\n\nNihonshoki explains that this move occurred in the 51st year of Keiko's reign, but shrine tradition also dates this event in the 1st year of Emperor Chūai's reign.Ponsonby-Fane, p. 435.\nThe Owari clan established the Atsuta Shrine in 192, and held the position of the shrine's high priest since ancient times, passing it down from generation to generation. Yamato Takeru and Miyazu-hime and her brother  are worshipped at the shrine.Ponsonby-Fane, p. 429.\n\nWhen Miyazu-hime died, a shrine was set up in her honor in Hikami. Her clan members became priests there. Inatane, the eleventh descendant of Amenohoakari, founded the Owari clan. As a result, Atsuta Myojin became the Owari clan's Ujigami.\n\nThe shrine, originally a Betsugu, later became a Sessha. It was founded in the fourth year of Chtiai (195), about 80 years after Yamato Takeru no Mikoto's death. Miyazu-hime was young when she knew Yamato Takeru no Mikoto.\n\nFamily tree\n\nNotelist",

It links Piazzale Maresciallo Giardino to Piazza Lauro De Bosis.\n\nThe Lungotevere was dedicated to the Marshal of Italy Luigi Cadorna, an Italian leader during World War I. It was established as per Governor resolution on March 8, 1937.\n\nFacilities\nThe Lungotevere is in the area of the Foro Italico, formerly Foro Mussolini. It includes the Foresteria Sud, a building designed between 1929 and 1932 by Enrico Del Debbio, who also modified it between 1936 and 1937 by adding a second floor entirely covered with white Carrara marble. The edifice became the seat of the CIVIS (the association of Italian blood donors) in 1957 and since 1967 is an hostel of youth.\n\nSport facilities in the Foro Italico were constructed between 1958 and 1960, ending with the completion of the Stadio Olimpico del Nuoto, based on a design by Enrico Del Debbio and Annibale Vitellozzi and used for important events such as the 1960 Summer Olympics, the 1983 European Aquatics Championships, the 1994 World Aquatics Championships and the 2009 World Aquatics Championships.",

    "title": "African dolls",
    "clean_text": "thumb|Ntwana beaded doll\n\nAfrican dolls across the continent are created for young girls to play with and as a charm to ensure fertility in women. Their shape and costume vary according to region and custom. Frequently dolls are handed down from mother to daughter. Western dolls are popular in Africa and are often dressed with traditional garb.\n\nWhen the doll concept is considered in the context of African culture, they are usually not children's playthings, but rather objects that are laden with ritual and religious associations within the community. African dolls are used to teach, and entertain. They are supernatural intermediaries and they are manipulated for ritual purposes. Each of these dolls is unique because they are handmade and are traditionally handed down through generations.\n\nNdebele dolls\nLinga Koba dolls are from the Ndebele people in Southern Africa. One of the smallest tribes of the region, the Ndebele are noted for their painted homes of brilliant colors that stand out in the drab countryside. Their clothing is similarly colorful. The bead work on these Ndebele dolls is as detailed as the clothing of the women themselves.\n\nDuring courtship, a suitor will place a doll outside a young woman's hut, indicating his intention to propose marriage to her. When a young woman is preparing to marry, she is given a doll that she names and cares for. Her first child is then named for the doll.\n\nIn addition to strengthening the Ndebele cultural identity, the beaded Ndebele dolls are now an important export item and much needed source of income for the Ndebele woman.\n\nXhosa dolls\nXhosa fertility dolls\nXhosa fertility dolls are beaded dolls made and worn by Xhosa women. The doll is also known as the ‘love doll’. It is made in order to attract an eligible husband and also increase fertility in order to produce many children. The dolls are believed to have supernatural magic powers. Young Xhosa girls are encouraged by older Xhosa women to wear the dolls around their necks in order to increase their fertility during childbearing ages. The girls are usually given their first doll by their parents when they start their initiation practice. The girl will look after it carefully since it is believed that if it is lost or damaged there is a risk that when she has a child, it will die. After the birth of her first child the young mother will return the doll to her parents for use by a younger sister. Traditionally, young women should not openly display that they are looking for a husband therefore, it is customary for them to wear the ‘love dolls’ for attracting purposes in the nighttime. These secret necklaces usually consist of both a male and a female doll on a single necklace while those worn openly have only one doll attached to them.\nMarried women also wear the dolls as a necklace in order to portray their desire to have children to the community and ancestors.Beck, R. (1989). Bibles and Beads: Missionaries as Traders in Southern Africa in the Early Nineteenth Century. The Journal of African History, 30(2), 211-225. doi:10.1017/S0021853700024105 Accessed 22 April 2018\n\nCharacteristics\nThe dolls are made of small bottles, maize cobs, cartridge cases or small rolls of cotton sheeting which are then covered in beadwork. The doll is then incorporated in a necklace.\nIn the early 20th century East London Museum had a collection of Xhosa fertility dolls which were described as ‘impressionistic’ at the time.\nCurrently all dolls are made with glass beads and glass beads have therefore become an integral part of the Xhosa tradition.Beck, R. (1989). Bibles and Beads: Missionaries as Traders in Southern Africa in the Early Nineteenth Century. The Journal of African History, 30(2), 211-225. doi:10.1017/S0021853700024105 Accessed 22 April 2018\n\nHut dolls\nThe Xesibe (a Xhosa tribe from the Eastern Cape) also have a practise of using \"hut dolls\". These dolls are carved of wood and put on the roof of the hut of a childless or seemingly infertile woman by a diviner as a plea to the ancestors to send a baby to the home. The doll may or may not have beads on it. It is left on the roof until a baby is born when it is taken down and burned with the placenta of the child.D.Costello. Not Only For Its Beauty.

    "clean_text": "The Trent Hills Thunder is the 2024 re-branding of the Campbellford Rebels a Canadian Junior ice hockey team based in Campbellford, Ontario, Canada.  They play in the Tod Division of the Provincial Junior Hockey League, and were formerly members of the Empire B Junior C Hockey League of the Ontario Hockey Association.\n\nHistory\nCampbellford's junior hockey history began in 1980.  The Campbellford Merchants joined the Quinte-St. Lawrence Junior C Hockey League.\n\nIn 1986, the Quinte-St. Lawrence league was falling apart and merged with the more western Central Ontario Junior C Hockey League.  The Merchants and most of the other local teams, like the Frankford Huskies, were forced into hiatus.\n\nIn 1989, The Eastern Ontario Junior C Hockey League was formed in the same region as the Quinte-St. Lawrence League.  In 1992, the Campbellford Rebels were formed to compete in the new league. The first goal in Rebels history was scored by Marc Emmons on October 7, 1992.  In 1995, the Eastern Ontario Junior C Hockey League became the Empire B Junior C Hockey League to stifle confusion between the league and the neighbouring Ottawa District Hockey Association's Eastern Ontario Junior C Hockey League.\n\nSuccess for the Rebels began in 1996.  The Rebels won the 1997, 1998, and 2000 league championships.  After disappointment in 2001 and 2002, the Rebels were again victorious in 2003 and 2004.  With five league championships in eight years, the Rebels have yet to win the Clarence Schmalz Cup as All-Ontario Champions.\n\nThe Rebels finished third overall in the 2005-06 regular season.  Because of a new divisionary system in the league, despite finishing the season with a losing record, the Rebels finished first in their division and received a bye to the league semi-final.    In the semi-final, the Rebels drew the Amherstview Jets who beat Campbellford 4-games-to-1.\n\nThe Rebels ended up in fourth place in the 2006-07 final standings.  Barely sneaking in on the final playoff spot, the Rebels came up against the top seeded Colborne Cobras who polished off Campbellford 4-games-to-none to move on to the league final.\n\nCampbellford had a great 2011-12 season and ended up in the league final vs the defending champions Picton Pirates.  The Rebels upset the Pirates to win the Empire B Championship.  In the provincials they advanced for the first time past the QF defeating the Clarington Eagles of the Central Ontario League in seven games.  Then the Rebels surprised everyone by winning the first three games of their SF vs the powerful Alliston Hornets of the Georgian Bay Mid Ontario League.  The Hornets sting came out in game 4 and the Rebels epi pen couldn't save them after that.

    "title": "San Tan Valley, Arizona",
    "clean_text": "San Tan Valley is an unincorporated community and census-designated place in northern Pinal County, Arizona, United States. The population was 99,894 at the 2020 census, it is the largest unincorporated community in Pinal County.\n\nHistory\nSan Tan Valley derives its name from the nearby San Tan Mountains. San Tan Valley was picked as the name for the area based on an informal public poll commissioned by now former Pinal County Supervisor Bryan Martyn.https://www.eastvalleytribune.com/news/san-tan-valley-chosen-as-areas-name/article_1ed4175d-dbf9-5de1-99a8-26b90cf8781c.html Previously referred to as San Tan Heights, San Tan Foothills, Greater San Tan and simply the San Tan Area, the community lacked any official name and residents used nearby Queen Creek for their mailing addresses.  To coincide with the addition of a new ZIP Code for the community on July 1, 2009, the United States Postal Service was petitioned to provide the area with a new name. As part of the initial request, \"Bella Vista\" name was submitted to the postal service, drawing the ire of some local residents who opposed the suggested name.  In response, the Greater San Tan Area Coalition organized a non-binding vote on June 23, offering residents the opportunity to vote on a name for the community.\n\nThe area, which had consisted primarily of undeveloped desert and agriculture prior to 2000, experienced considerable growth in the early part of the decade.  As early as 2004, attempts to incorporate the area were underway.  An initial attempt, which proposed a name of simply \"San Tan\" for the area, was blocked by the neighboring town of Florence after rural residents there expressed concern that allowing incorporation would accelerate the urbanization of the area. A subsequent effort in 2005 failed to gain traction.  Following the renaming of the area in 2009, a renewed effort at incorporation sought to put the issue to a vote in 2010, this time with the support of Pinal County. The Town Council of Florence unanimously rejected a resolution that would have approved San Tan Valley's proposed boundaries over concerns of their allotment of state shared revenue.\n\nGeography\nSan Tan Valley is located at  (33.178592, -111.562823).\n\nSan Tan Valley is located in the unincorporated area between the towns of Queen Creek to the north and west, and Florence to the south.  The area is also bound by the San Tan Mountains Regional Park on the west and the Gila River Indian Community on the southwest.  The area consists largely of planned communities, such as Pecan Creek South, San Tan Heights, Archer Meadows, and Johnson Ranch.\n\nClimate\nSituated east of the San Tan Mountains, the community is located in the Sonoran Desert.  As such, it experiences the hot, arid summers and moderate winters that typify the area. According to the Köppen climate classification, San Tan Valley has a hot desert climate (abbreviated BWh).\n\nDemographics\n\n2020 census\nAs of the 2020 census, there were 99,894 people. The racial and ethnic composition of the population was 68.7% white, 5.0% black or African American, 1.4% Native American, 1.9% Asian, 0.4% Pacific Islander, 13.4% two more or races, 9.3% reporting some other race. The population was 25.4% Hispanic or Latino (of any race).\n\n2010 census\nAs of the 2010 census, there were 81,321 people. The racial and ethnic composition of the population was 66.2% non-Hispanic white, 5.0% black or African American, 1.2% Native American, 2.1% Asian, 0.3% Pacific Islander, 0.2% non-Hispanic reporting some other race and 23.4% Hispanic or Latino.\n\nEducation\nSan Tan Valley is serviced by the following school districts. - Text list Each district has its own high school located within San Tan Valley:\n Florence Unified School District (Poston Butte High School, San Tan Foothills High School))\n J.

The telenovela still ran for a further 17 chapters to wrap up the plot, for a total of 137 episodes. Since the telenovela that would succeed it in the timeslot, Louco Amor, hadn't yet begun production at that point, a truncated rerun of 1976's O Casarão was shown in the timeslot until Louco Amor's debut.\n\nIt was the twenty ninth \"novela das oito\" to be aired on the timeslot.

    "clean_text": "The United States Secret Service Uniformed Division (USSS UD) is the federal police force of the U.S. Secret Service, similar to the U.S. Capitol Police or DHS Federal Protective Service. It is in charge of protecting the physical White House grounds and foreign diplomatic missions in the District of Columbia area.\n\nHistory\nthumb|left|A USSS Uniformed Division police officer and a USSS Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor near the White House in 2012\nthumb|left|A 2013 Ford Police Interceptor of the U.S. Secret Service Uniformed Division is pictured outside the White House in Washington, D.C., in July 2013\nthumb|Secret Service Ford Taurus\nthumb|Secret Service Ford Police Interceptor Utility\nthumb|left|A U.S. Secret Service \"counter-sniper\" marksman on top of the White House's roof, armed with a sniper rifle\nthumb|right|A member of the Secret Service\nEstablished in 1922 as the White House Police, this organization was fully integrated into the Secret Service in 1930. In 1970, the protection of foreign diplomatic missions was added to the force's responsibilities, and its name was changed to the Executive Protective Service. The name United States Secret Service Uniformed Division was adopted in 1977.\n\nIn 1970, Phyllis Shantz became the first female officer sworn into the United States Secret Service Uniformed Division, then called the Executive Protective Service. In 1971, the first five official female Special Agents were sworn in - Laurie Anderson, Sue Baker, Kathryn Clark, Holly Hufschmidt, and Phyllis Shantz.\n\nWith more than 1,300 officers as of 2010, the Uniformed Division is responsible for security at the White House Complex; the vice president's residence; the Department of the Treasury (as part of the White House Complex); and foreign diplomatic missions in the District of Columbia area. Uniformed Division officers carry out their protective responsibilities through a network of fixed security posts, foot, bicycle, vehicular and motorcycle patrols.\n\nOrganization\nThe Uniformed Division has four branches: the White House Branch, the Foreign Missions Branch, the Naval Observatory Branch and the Special Operations Branch. Together they provide protection for the following: the president, vice president, and their immediate families; presidential candidates; the White House Complex; the Vice President's Residence; the main Treasury Department building and its annex facility; and foreign diplomatic missions in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area.\n\nOfficers are responsible for providing additional support to the Secret Service's protective mission through the following five Special Operations Branch units:\n\n Counter Sniper Team (CS) Created in 1971, the Counter Sniper Team's purpose is to provide specialized protective support to defend against long-range threats to Secret Service protectees. Counter snipers work in pairs with one acting as a spotter. In 2016, CBS Evening News reported that no CS member had to fire a shot since the unit was formed. In July 2024, the CS shot and killed Thomas Matthew Crooks who had attempted to assassinate Donald Trump, the Republican Party's then-presumptive nominee in the 2024 presidential election, at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\n Canine Explosives Detection Unit (K-9) Created in 1976, the mission of the K-9 unit is to provide skilled and specialized explosives detection support to protective efforts involving Secret Service protectees.\n\n Emergency Response Team (ERT) Created in 1985, ERT's primary mission is to provide tactical response to unlawful intrusions and other protective challenges related to the White House and its grounds. ERT personnel receive specialized, advanced training and must maintain a high level of physical and operational proficiency. The ERT includes the Specialized Rifle Unit. Since 2003, the ERT has included tactical K9 units.\n\n Airspace Security Branch Develops and implements security plans to monitor and control the airspace surrounding locations visited by the president and vice president of the United States, National Special Security Events and other designated major events. \n\n Hazardous Agent Mitigation Medical Emergency Response (HAMMER) Created in 2004, HAMMER supports the agency's protective mission through chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) detection and intervention, emergency medical support and rescue/extrication capabilities.\n\nOfficers assigned to CS, ERT, and K9, are designated \"Technicians\" to recognize their advanced training.\n\nThe Division also has the following other units:\n\n Magnetometer Support Team Formed to ensure that all persons entering secure areas occupied by Secret Service protectees are unarmed, the Secret Service began relying on magnetometer (metal detector) support by Uniformed Division officers to augment its protective efforts away from the White House following the attempt to assassinate President Ronald Reagan.\n\n Crime Scene Search Unit Photographs, collects, and processes physical and latent evidence.\n\n Motorcade Support Unit Specializes in the operational support for all official protectee motorcade movements.\n\n Special Operations Section Handles special duties and functions at the White House Complex, including conducting tours.\n\nThe Secret Service Uniformed Division's statutory authority is set out in Title 18, §3056A of the U.S. Code.\n\nRanks\nUniformed Division ranks, set out in the salary schedule in Title 5, § 10203 of the United States Code, are as follows:\n\nthumb|right|A United States Secret Service sniper team at a Trump rally in The Villages, Florida, in October 2020\n Chief\n Assistant Chief\n Deputy Chief\n Inspector\n Captain\n Lieutenant\n Sergeant\n Officer\n\nCurrent weapons\nLike all other officers, the standard sidearm for the Uniformed Division is the 9mm Glock 19. Officers are trained on standard shoulder weapons that include the FN P90 submachine gun, the 9mm Heckler & Koch MP5 submachine gun, and the 12-gauge Remington 870 shotgun.Jones, Richard D. Jane's Infantry Weapons 2009/2010. Jane's Information Group; 35th edition (January 27, 2009). . The continued use of the MP5 remains a source of controversy as many other federal agencies have moved away from submachine guns altogether and replaced them with automatic rifles.\n\nAs a non-lethal option, Uniformed Division Officers are armed with the ASP 16\" expandable baton, and Uniformed Division officers also carry pepper spray and X20-series tasers.\n\nUnits assigned to the Special Operations Branch carry a variety of non-standard weapons. The Emergency Response Team (ERT) is issued with the Knight's Armament Company SR-16 CQB rifle chambered in 5.56×45mm NATO. \n\nUniformed Division technicians assigned to the Counter Sniper Team use custom built .300 Winchester Magnum-chambered bolt-action rifles referred to as JARs (\"Just Another Rifle\"). These rifles use Remington 700 actions in Accuracy International stocks with Schmidt & Bender optics. CS technicians also use the 7.62mm Mk11 Mod 0 semi-automatic sniper rifle with a Trijicon 5.5× ACOG optic. \"The Gear and Guns of the Secret Service\". World of Firepower.

In 937, Kiều Công Tiễn assassinated the Jiedushi to seize his position and thus provoked a revolt led by Ngô Quyền who sought revenge his lord and father-in-law Dương Đình Nghệ. In response to the attack, Kiều Công Tiễn appealed to Liu Yan, the emperor of Southern Han, for reinforcements but he was defeated and executed by Ngô Quyền before the army of Southern Han entered the country. Ngô Quyền subsequently won a decisive victory over the Southern Han in the Battle of Bạch Đằng River and would go on to inaugurate the continuous independence of Vietnam for the first time in nearly a thousand years.\n\nHistory\nAccording to Từ điển Bách khoa toàn thư Việt Nam, the date of birth of Kiều Công Tiễn was unknown but he was from Phong Châu (now Phú Thọ, Vietnam) where he was a notable of the region. Commonly, the chữ Hán characters of his name (矯公羨) are transcribed in Vietnamese as Kiều Công Tiễn but there are some sources such as the Khâm định Việt sử thông giám cương mục or the Việt Nam sử lược of Trần Trọng Kim use the transcription Kiểu Công Tiện. In several ancient historical books of China like the New History of the Five Dynasties, his family name (矯, Kiều) was recorded by another character 皎 which is often transcribed as Kiểu in Vietnamese.\n\nWhen Dương Đình Nghệ took over the position of Jiedushi of Tĩnh Hải quân in 931 from the Southern Han, Kiều Công Tiễn was chosen as a general in the court of Dương Đình Nghệ, according to the Đại Việt sử lược, Kiều Công Tiễn was the adopted son of the Jiedushi. In the third month of lunar calendar in 937, Kiều Công Tiễn assassinated Dương Đình Nghệ in order to seize his position of Jiedushi. Nine months later, Ngô Quyền, another general of Dương Đình Nghệ, commanded his army from the Ái province (now Thanh Hóa) to rise a revolt against Kiều Công Tiễn in revenging his lord and father-in-law Dương Đình Nghệ. In response to Ngô Quyền's military campaign, Kiều Công Tiễn decided to seek help from the emperor of Southern Han Liu Yan who also wanted to profit the chaos in Tĩnh Hải quân to regain control of Giao Chỉ. Because of his action against Dương Đình Nghệ and the call on Chinese aid, Kiễu Công Tiễn is denounced by many Vietnamese historians as a usurper in history of Vietnam.\n\nAfter accepting the appeal of Kiều Công Tiễn, Liu Yan appointed his son Liu Yuancao the new Jiedushi of Tĩnh Hải quân, which was renamed as King of Giao Chỉ (Giao vương), and personally conducted the reinforcements for Kiều Công Tiễn. Before the troops of Southern Han entered the territory of Tĩnh Hải quân, Ngô Quyền got ahead by defeating and executing Kiều Công Tiễn in 938 and prepared to catch the army of Liu Yan in Bạch Đằng River. Finally Liu Yan's army was defeated in the Battle of Bạch Đằng River where his son Liu Yuancao was killed in action, the emperor of Southern Han had to abandon his military campaign and Ngô Quyền thus successfully secured the country from invaders and marked the beginning of the independence of Vietnam from Chinese authorities. After the death of Ngô Quyền in 944, Vietnam again fell into troubled times with the 12 Lords Rebellion in which Kiều Công Hãn and Kiều Thuận, grandsons of Kiều Công Tiễn, were among the principal warlords.",

    "clean_text": "Digital asset management (DAM) and the implementation of its use as a computer application is required in the collection of digital assets to ensure that the owner, and possibly their delegates, can perform operations on the data files.\n\nTerminology \n\nThe term media asset management (MAM) may be used in reference to Digital Asset Management when applied to the sub-set of digital objects commonly considered \"media\", namely audio recordings, photos, and videos. Any editing process that involves media, especially video, can make use of a MAM to access media components to be edited together or combined with a live feed in a fluent manner. A MAM typically offers at least one searchable index of the images, audio, and videos it contains, constructed from metadata harvested from the images using pattern recognition, or input manually.\n\nDigital asset management (DAM) may focus on the electronic management of any form of a digitally stored piece of information. DAM is certainly strategic, while MAM is almost always tactical. Both asset management primarily reflect long-term stored content that is used for archiving, preservation, and most notably reuse.\n\nManagement\n\nCreation\n\nApplications implement Digital Asset Management (DAM) by importing it from the analog and/or digital domains (by encoding, scanning, optical character recognition, etc.) or by authoring it as a new object.\n\nIndexing\nA primary function of a DAM system is to make assets easily available to its users by providing a searchable index that supports retrieval of assets by their content and/or metadata. The cataloging function is usually part of the ingestion process for new assets.\n\nWorkflow\nDigital assets will typically have a lifecycle, which may include various states such as creation, approval, live, archived, and deleted.\n\nVersion control\nOften a DAM system will store earlier versions of a digital asset and allow those to be downloaded or reverted to. Therefore, a DAM system can operate as an advanced type of version control system.\n\nAccess control\nFinally, a DAM system typically includes security controls ensuring relevant people have access to assets. This will often involve integration with existing directory services via a technology such as single sign-on.\n\nCategorization \n\nSmaller DAM systems are used in a particular operational context, for instance, in video production systems. The key differentiators between them are the types of input encoders used for creating digital copies of assets to bring them under management, and the output decoders and/or formatters used to make them usable as documents and/or online resources. The metadata of a content item can serve as a guide to the selection of the codec(s) needed to handle the content during processing and may be of use when applying access control rules to enforce authorization policy.* \n\n Requirements \nAssets that require specific technologies to be used in a workflow need to have their bandwidth, latency, and access control requirements considered in the design of the tools that create or store them, as well as in the architecture of the system that distributes and archives them.\nWhen assets are not actively being worked on, they can be stored in a DAM in various formats, including as a blob (binary large object in a database) or as a file in a standard file system, which is \"cheaper\" to store than the form needed during operations on them. This allows the implementation of large-scale DAM as an assembly of high-performance processing systems within a network with a high-density storage solution at its center.\n\nTypes of systems\n\nDigital asset management systems fall into the following classifications:\n Brand management system: Enforce brand presentation within an organization by making approved logos, fonts, and product images easily accessible.\n Library or archive: Provide bulk storage of infrequently changing video or photo assets.\n Media asset management systems: Handling assets in the audiovisual domain including audio, video, or still images.\n Production management systems: Manage assets being created on the fly for use in live media production or as visual effects for use in gaming applications, TV, or films.\n Streaming: Facilitate on-demand delivery of digital content, like TV shows or movies, to end users on behalf of digital retailers.\n\nAll of these types will include features for workflow management, collaboration, project management, and revision control.\n\nMedia asset issues \n\nAn asset can exist in several formats and in a sequence of versions. The digital version of the original asset is generally captured in as high resolution, colour depth, and (if applicable) frame rate as needed to ensure that results are of acceptable quality for the end-use. There can also be thumbnail copies of lower quality for use in visual indexing.\n\nMetadata for an asset can include its packaging, encoding, provenance, ownership and access rights, and location of original creation. It is used to provide hints to the tools and systems used to work on, or with, the asset about how it should be handled and displayed.",

Winston Co., 1910; William Rowley, A Shoemaker a Gentleman, edited by Trudy Laura Darby, London, Globe Quartos, Nick Hern Books, 2002. It may be Rowley's only extant solo comedy.\n\nNineteenth-century scholars and critics generally classified four plays as solo Rowley works – the tragedy All's Lost by Lust and the comedies A Shoemaker a Gentleman, A Match at Midnight, and A New Wonder, a Woman Never Vexed. Twentieth-century researchers have questioned Rowley's sole authorship of the latter two dramas.\n\nPublication\nA Shoemaker a Gentleman was entered into the Stationers' Register on 28 November 1637, and first appeared in print in 1638, in a quarto printed and published by John Okes and sold by the stationer John Cooper (or Cowper). This 1638 quarto was the only edition of the play in the seventeenth century. Authorship is assigned to \"W. R.\" on the title page.E. K. Chambers, The Elizabethan Stage, 4 Volumes, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1923; Vol. 3, p. 473.\n\nDate and performance\nThe date of the play is not known with certainty, and its early performance history is largely a blank. The title page of the 1638 quarto states that the work was \"sundry times acted at the Red Bull and other theaters, with general and good applause.\" Okes' dedication of the play to the guild of shoemakers also mentions the play's popularity, and states that \"some twenty years agone, it was in the fashion.\" This suggests a date c. 1618 for the play's origin, though the \"twenty years\" figure could be only an approximation. Commentators have suggested dates of authorship as early as c. 1608.\n\nThe comic subplot of the play was extracted and performed as a \"droll,\" and was often staged at Bartholomew Fair and Southwark Fair during the middle and later decades of the seventeenth century. The play was revived at least once during the Restoration era.\n\nSources and influences\nRowley drew upon several sources for the plot of his play, notably William Caxton's The Golden Legend and Thomas Deloney's The Gentle Craft.Stanley Wells, \"William Rowley and The Golden Legend,\" Notes and Queries 6 (1959), pp. 129–30; Gina M. Di Salvo, \"Saints' Lives and Shoemakers' Holidays: The Gentle Craft and the Wells Cordwainers' Pageant of 1613\", Early Theatre 19 (2016), pp. 119–138. (Deloney's work also inspired Thomas Dekker's famous play The Shoemaker's Holiday.)Terence P. Logan and Denzell S. Smith, eds., The Popular School: A Survey and Bibliography of Recent Studies in English Renaissance Drama, Lincoln, NE, University of Nebraska Press, 1975; p. 11. Rowley depended on the Chronicles of Raphael Holinshed for his account of the early Christian martyr St. Alban (\"Albon\" in the play).\n\nA Shoemaker a Gentleman shares a range of resemblances and common features with other plays of its era. Its general ambience is strongly similar to Dekker's Shoemaker's Holiday. Its setting in ancient Britain, and its plot device of the two British princes living humble lives in disguise and under assumed names, suggests Shakespeare's Cymbeline. The play also bears a significant inter-relationship with The Birth of Merlin, another play in the Rowley canon.Mark Dominik, William Shakespeare and \"The Birth of Merlin,\"  Beaverton, OR, Alioth Press, 1991; pp. 32–3 and ff.\n\nGenre\nA Shoemaker a Gentleman is securely in the tradition of the popular realistic comedy of its era.Alexander Leggatt, Jacobean Public Drama, London, Routledge, 1992; pp. 51, 57, 65, 70 and ff. Additionally, its serious subplot shows the influence of the religious and hagiographic drama of the later Middle Ages. The saints' plays that characterized that era had largely passed out of fashion by Rowley's generation, though they could still exert some influence – Dekker and Massinger's The Virgin Martyr (1622) being the obvious example. Rowley includes a comparable religious subplot in The Birth of Merlin.\n\nSynopsis\nThe play is set in Roman Britain in the period around 300 CE, during the reign of Diocletian and Maximian. (The latter is called \"Maximinus\" in the play.) The opening scene shows the Roman army in battle with the fictitious British king Allured. Allured is killed in the fighting, and his Queen (otherwise unnamed) insists that her sons, Elred (or Eldred) and Offa, flee the field to avoid death or capture. The two princes reluctantly comply; the Queen is apprehended by the Romans. Her speeches to the two emperors reveal that she is a Christian.\n\nElred and Offa assume humble disguises, Elred calling himself Crispianus, and Offa, Crispinus or Crispin. They make for Faversham in KentArthur Percival, The Faversham Legends of Crispin and Crispianus, Princes and Saints, Faversham Papers No. 73, Faversham Society, 1999 become apprentices for the (otherwise unnamed) Shoemaker and his wife. This couple and their other apprentices, Barnaby and Raphe, provide much of the play's overt comedy. The Shoemaker supplies footwear to the princess Leodice, the daughter of Maximinus; it is through this connection that Leodice meets, and quickly falls in love with, Offa/Crispin. Conversations between Leodice and her Nurse (who resembles the Nurse in Romeo and Juliet) reveal the princess's infatuation; they also specify that both Diocletian and Maximinus climbed to their present high stations from humble beginnings. Crispin's touching and measuring Leodice's feet provides risqué humor. Soon enough, Leodice reveals her feelings to Crispin, and the two enter into a secret marriage.\n\nWhile Crispin is out with Leodice, a press gang from the Roman army comes to the Shoemaker's shop looking for new soldiers; Elred/Crispianus, motivated by his innate princely valor, is willingly drafted. The military action has shifted from Britain to northern Germany, where the Romans are fighting the Goths and Vandals. Crispianus fights bravely and distinguishes himself in combat. When Diocletian and the Romans' eagle insignia are captured by Huldrick, king of the Goths, Crispianus rescues the emperor and the eagle; he kills Huldrick and captures Roderick the Vandal king, making himself the great hero of the victory.\n\nAmong the Roman force is an officer called Albon. Under the influence of the Christian hermit Amphiabel, Albon converts to Christianity. The emperors discover his conversion, and capture and torture both Albon and Amphiabel. Both go to martyrdom true to their faith.\n\nWhen the Roman army returns to Britain they are mistaken for an invading force; a public panic ensues. Leodice is by now expecting her first child with husband Crispin; amid a good deal of rushing about with the Nurse and hostile comments from the Shoemaker's wife, the princess gives birth. By the play's end, both Crispin and Crispianus are recognized as the royal princes they are. In light of Crispianus' military heroism and Crispin's marriage with Leodice, the emperors accept them as client kings, Offa/Crispin ruling the north of Britain and Elred/Crispianus ruling the south. Their mother the Queen is released from captivity; their Christianity, despite previous persecutions, is accepted.\n\nThe play's subplot relates the story of St. Winifred, though Rowley places it three centuries earlier than historical accuracy would dictate. Winifred is a young noblewoman pursued by suitors, most prominently a Welsh nobleman called Sir Hugh; but Winifed desires to follow her religious vocation in preference to marriage. Her choice is validated when an angel appears to her at St. Winifred's Well. Sir Hugh agrees to a three-month suspension of his suit; but even after that time, Winifred is determined to refuse him. Discouraged by the Britons' military defeat and his own rejection, Hugh abandons his high station to pursue a humble life; he too becomes an apprentice in the Shoemaker's shop. Eventually Winifred is apprehended by the Romans and martyred; Sir Hugh loyally remains by her side and joins her in martyrdom, dying apparently from grief. Sir Hugh's status as nobleman, shoemaker, and martyr earns the trade of shoemaking the honorific of \"the gentle craft,\" and the shoemakers' tools are from then on known as \"St. Hugh's bones.\"",

    "title": "QF 18-pounder gun",
    "clean_text": "The Ordnance QF 18-pounder,British military traditionally denoted smaller ordnance by the weight of its standard projectile, in this case approximately  or simply 18-pounder gun, was the standard British Empire field gun of the First World War era. It formed the backbone of the Royal Field Artillery during the war, and was produced in large numbers. It was used by British Forces in all the main theatres, and by British troops in Russia in 1919. Its calibre (84 mm) and shell weight were greater than those of the equivalent field guns in French (75 mm) and German (77 mm) service. It was generally horse drawn until mechanisation in the 1930s.\n\nThe first versions were introduced in 1904. Later versions remained in service with British forces until early 1942. During the interwar period, the 18-pounder was developed into the early versions of the Ordnance QF 25-pounder, which would form the basis of the British artillery forces during and after the Second World War in much the same fashion as the 18-pounder had during the First.\n\nHistory \nDuring the Second Boer War, the British government realised that its field artillery was being overtaken by the more modern \"quick-firing\" guns of other major powers, and investigated replacements for its existing field gun, the BL 15-pounder 7 cwt. In 1900, General Sir Henry Brackenbury, the then director-general of ordnance, sent officers to visit European gun makers. At Rheinische Metallwaren und Maschinenfabrik in Düsseldorf, they found a quick firing gun designed by Heinrich Ehrhardt with a recoil system that totally absorbed all the recoil of firing, 108 guns plus spares, were secretly purchased and entered service as the Ordnance QF 15-pounder in June 1901.Headlam, p.13\n\nAt the same time, the British Cabinet ordered Field Marshal Lord Roberts, the Commander-in-Chief in South Africa, to send home artillery brigade and battery commanders \"selected for their eminence and experience\" to form an Equipment Committee. The committee was chaired by General Sir George Marshall, who had been artillery commander in South Africa.Headlam, p. 73 It formed in January 1901 with a wide-ranging area of study from horse-drawn mobile guns and the larger more static field guns, to harness design, and even binoculars.Headlam, Appendix B They swiftly established the \"conditions to be fulfilled by proposed new equipment\"; the most important were the \"weight behind the team\", then ballistics, rapidity of fire, weight of shell, provision of shield and number of rounds carried.Headlam, Appendix C\n\nBritish gun manufacturers were invited to propose designs. Of the many entries, five for the horse artillery gun and three for the field gun were selected and their makers invited to submit a \"specimen\". These were tested in 1902, but none was found suitable for service although they all had good features. The makers were called to a conference and agreed to collaborate to produce a composite design. This used the Armstrong gun, Vickers' recoil system, and Royal Ordnance Factory's sighting and elevating gear and ammunition carrying. Reduced wheel size from  to  was also accepted (it had been a matter the Equipment Committee had to investigate) which saved weight. Four Artillery batteries of the composite design took part in trials of in 1903, and the new 18-pounder design was accepted.Headlam, pp. 73–74\n\nThe cost of rearmament was huge, and it took some pressure from the press for the War Office to follow through. Initially the British Indian Army was re-equipped first; however, the First Moroccan Crisis changed the priorities. In the end the weapon phase-in cost £4 million (equivalent to £ with the GDP deflator) and became the biggest such undertaking to the date in British Army history.\n\nThe 18-pounder was used on all fronts during the First World War. It remained in service during the inter-war period. Starting in 1938, carriages Marks IV and V were converted to 25-pounder Ordnance QF Mark 1 on Carriage Mark 1. 18-pounder Guns served with the British Expeditionary Force in France in the Second World War and were used in other theatres as well as for training or beach defence.\n\nDescription \nthumb|left|\nthumb|left|\nthumb|left|\nThe 18-pounder was a quick-firing horse-drawn field gun designed to be towed behind a limber and six horses. The gun barrel was wire-wound nickel-steel with a single-motion screw breech with a cartridge extractor. It fired a fixed round of shell and cartridge fixed together, which was known as \"quick firing\" in British terminology. The lower carriage comprised a single hollow steel trail fixed to the centre of the axle-tree. The limited traverse saddle supported the elevating mass and a shield. Traverse controls were on the left and elevation on the right of the saddle. Recoil was by a hydraulic buffer with telescopic running-up springs to return the barrel to its firing position.\n\nThe Equipment Committee's conditions required tangent sights (i.e. direct fire) with the option of a telescope. However, the 18-pounder entered service with rocking bar (also called \"bar and drum\") sights – open sights with the option of a telescope on the left and a range scale (in yards) on the right of the cradle. These arrangements also incorporated independent line of sight, meaning that the sights could remain laid on the target while the barrel was elevated or depressed. A clinometer was provided for indirect fire when the sight was aimed using a gun-arc (a refined version of the expedient devices used in South Africa) and aiming posts in line horizontally with the target.\n\nIn 1906 indirect fire goniometric sights were adopted which consisted of an alidade mounted on a circular scale graduated in degrees that was mounted on the shield. In 1910, the Number 3 Dial Sight, a refined version with a telescope and compass, replaced the goniometer. The rocking bar and telescope were retained for direct fire, as was the range scale on the right in spite of a clinometer being part of the Dial Sight mount.\n\nIn 1910, after three years of trials, the Number 7 Dial Sight was adopted. This was a very heavily modified version (notably using external instead of internal scales) of the German Goertz panoramic sight. This, with its sight mount that again included a sight clinometer, replaced the No 3. However, resolving various issues, notably with the sight and mount carrying case mounted on the shield, meant that the Number 7 sight did not enter service until early in 1914.Headlam, p. 97 and 105\n\nUnusually for a 20th-century British gun, the 18-pounder retained two-man laying throughout its life, elevation (in yards) was set on a range scale on the righthand side of the cradle. The Equipment Committee had also insisted on better methods of fuze setting, important because until late in 1914 it only had time fuzed ammunition. A hand held mechanical fuze setter was developed, and in early 1914 a \"fuze indicator\" was introduced, this converted the range into a fuze setting.\n\n Mk I Gun on Mk I Carriage \nthumb|left|\nThe Ordnance Quick Firing 18-pounder Mark I gun barrel was wire-wound for one-third of its length, chosen as it was lighter, stronger and cheaper to manufacture than a fully built-up barrel.Hall, June 1973 A jacket was shrunk over the wire and \"A\" tube. The Mk I gun and Mk I carriage were accepted into service on 30 June 1904.\n\nThe narrow single-pole trail design of the Carriages Mk I and II were suited to towing by teams of horses, but constrained downward motion of the breech, and thus limited the gun's range to 6525 yards in normal use. The range could be increased to 7800 yards by \"digging in\" the end of the pole trail to increase elevation. Its distinguishing feature was the barrel, significantly longer than the 13-pounder's and, unlike the 13-pounder, the barrel was significantly longer than the recuperator housing above it.\n\n Mk II Gun on Mk I Carriage \nThe original gun design was quickly replaced in production from 1906 by the \"rationalized\" Mark II gun for ease of relining : the exterior of the inner \"A\" tube was slightly tapered, and was inserted into a matching tapered jacket by hydraulic pressure.Pages 5 & 6 in \"Handbook of the 18-PR. Q.F. GUN – Land Service\", 1913\n\nMark I and II guns were still in use in the post-First World War era, and some saw combat in the Far East in Second World War.\n\n Mk II Gun on High-angle Anti-aircraft mounting \nIn early 1915, a number of 18-pounder guns were mounted on pedestals, with the addition of a second recuperator and retaining catch for the cartridge case at high angle, in an attempt to come up with a workable anti-aircraft gun. The gun's relatively low muzzle velocity, and the unsatisfactory ballistic characteristics of its shrapnel shell at high angles, made it a marginal performer in such a role.Hogg & Thurston, p.84 However, by sleeving the barrel down to  and mating the 18-pounder cartridge with the 13-pounder's shell, the successful QF 13-pounder 9 cwt anti-aircraft gun was produced with the necessary high muzzle velocity.\n\nThe early versions of 18-pounder anti-aircraft guns remained in service, apparently only in the home defense of Britain. 35 were in service in Britain in June 1916Farndale 1986, p.397 and 56 at the end of the First World War.Routledge, p.27 After the war, they were converted back to field gun use by removing the cartridge retaining catch.\n\n Mk II Gun on Mk I Carriage with armoured oil reservoir on recuperator \nthumb|left|\nBattlefield experience in 1914 and 1915 showed up the weakness of the original recuperator springs (which returned the barrel to firing position after recoil) and loss of oil in the recuperator under intense firing. Poor quality of wartime manufacture of the springs was also a factor.Hogg & Thurston, p.80 Spring shortages due to breakages meant guns remained in the firing line and had to be \"run up\" – have the barrel moved forward into its firing position – by hand, hence slowing the rate of fire.Farndale 1986, p.135 A temporary preventive measure was the addition of a distinctive armoured box-shaped oil reservoir to the front end of the recuperator to maintain the oil supply and extend spring life. This modification is visible in many photographs of 18-pounders in action on the Western Front right up to the end of the war\n\n Mk I* and II Carriage \nthumb|\nThe recuperator spring problem was rectified with the new Mk II carriage officially introduced in the field in November 1916 with a hydro-pneumatic recuperator design which replaced the recuperator springs with a system driven by air compression and could be fitted into the existing spring housing by battery officers in the field.Hogg & Thurston, p.80. They state that the modification was actually being made \"some time before this\". It is identified by the  torpedo-shaped extension on the recuperator, which made the recuperator assembly nearly as long as the barrel and hence altered the equipment profile. Converted existing carriages were designated Mk I*. The Mk II carriage also incorporated a longer cradle.\n\nIn about 1917, all 18-pounders began to be fitted with a new calibrating range scale. This allowed the gun's muzzle velocity to be set on it and automatically corrected the range for the difference between the actual muzzle velocity and the standard one.\n\n Mk III gun on High-angle Carriage \nAn experimental Mk III gun was developed in 1916. It had a semi-automatic horizontal sliding block breech, with the recoil mechanism below rather than above the gun barrel. The high-angle mounting may have been an experimental dual anti-aircraft and field carriage. The design did not enter service.Hogg & Thurston, p.86\nthumb|left|300px|Mk IV gun on Mk IV carriage (right), with original wooden spoked wheels, training, 1940.

III carriage\nthumb|Studio photo of the Mk. IV gun on Mk. III carriage\n\nA major variant (essentially, a new artillery piece with the same ballistics) was the Mark IV gun on Mk IV carriage. The Mk IV gun started testing in 1916 mounted on a new Mk III carriage with box trail, then typical for howitzers. This eliminated the original central pole trail, which had restricted elevation, allowing increased elevation to 37.5 degrees and hence increased maximum range from 6525 to 9300 yards with the 2 charge shell.\n\nMk III carriage was quickly superseded by Mk IV carriage as the standard field carriage.\n\nMk III and IV carriages incorporated a new variable-recoil hydro-pneumatic system and moved from above to below the gun barrel. The new single-motion \"Asbury breech\" allowed for higher rates of fire and a Welin tapered screw adopted for the breech. A single battery of the Mk IV gun on the early Mk III carriage was serving with 4th Army when the First World War ended.Clarke, p.39 The new gun and carriage was in effect a new weapon but as the calibre and ammunition remained the same it was referred to as part of the 18 pr development cycle until the calibre was phased out.\n\nBy 1919, the standard British field gun was the 18-pounder Mk IV gun on Mk IV carriage but Britain still possessed many of the older Marks.\nthumb|left|An 18-pounder on an elastic mount for shipboard use (DAMS)\n\n Naval Use \nIn addition to its land role 184 guns were converted to arm Defensively Armed Merchant Ships (DAMS) against U-boat attack during the First World War.  The conversion entailed mounting the guns on the same type of elastic mount used by the QF 6-pounder Hotchkiss.\n\n Wagons and Limbers \nThe \"carriage\" limber, towed between the gun and horse team, carried 24 rounds of ammunition. Each gun was accompanied by a second horse team towing an ammunition wagon and wagon limber carrying the gun detachment (none were carried on the gun limber) and 38 rounds in each. In action, the wagon was placed close beside the gun; its steel body provided an extended shield to protect the detachments against small arms fire.\n\nThe towed weight of the gun and loaded limber was 40 cwt (2,000 kg), the wagon and its limber were about 37 cwt. Each battery also held a second wagon and wagon limber per gun, giving first line ammunition stocks of 176 rounds per gun.\n\n Inter-War Period \nthumb|left|Split trail of the Mk. VP carriage, ca. 1938\nOn 28 June 1922, Michael Collins effectively started the Irish Civil War by using two 18-pounder field guns, previously owned by the British Army, to bombard the Four Courts in Dublin.\n\nThe Mk V carriage with split trail entered service in 1923, it allowed 25 degrees left and right traverse without moving the trail and up to 37.5 degrees elevation. In the same year the Army began a full-scale mechanisation of the artillery: Vickers Medium Dragon tracked artillery tractors were used to tow the gun, and the horse teams began to be returned to the Army Remount Service.\n\nIn 1925, some guns were experimentally fitted on a Medium tank chassis as self-propelled artillery (the \"Birch gun\"), the Birch gun was used for the exercises of the Experimental Mechanized Force in 1927–1928.\n\nThe Mk IV ordnance was modified. In the Mk IVA, the A tube and wire were replaced by an autofrettaged loose liner. The Mk IVB was the same with minor modifications, most notably 3 shoulders instead of 2. A Mk V ordnance was designed but does not appear to have entered service.Range Table for Ordnance QF, 18-pr Mks I to V 2CRH Shrapnel, 4/7.5 CRH HE, 1929\nthumb|The gun on Mk. VP carriage with its modified armour shield on pneumatic tyres with limber towed by Morris CDSW tractor, 1938\nIn the 1930s, as the British Army started to fully mechanise, all guns were converted to mechanised towing. Initially, this was by fitting heavy wooden wheels with solid rubber tyres, the carriages becoming Mks IIITR, IVR and VR. Subsequently, wooden wheels were replaced by new axles, steel wheels, pneumatic tyres and modern brakes. The Mk IV and V carriages had a British conversion to produce the Mk IVP and VP on 9.00 X 16\" wheels. The Mk IIs, with their pole trails, had the American 'Martin Parry' conversion to produce the Mk IIPA on 7.50 X 24\" wheels. Unlike other guns, 18-pounder was not converted to Probert pattern calibrating sights.\n\nIntroduction of a new streamlined shell, Mk 1C, with a 4/7.5 crh increased maximum range to 11,100 yards with Mks III, IV and V carriages.Range Table for Ordnance QF, 18-pr Mks I to IV 2CRH Shrapnel, 4/7.5 CRH HE, 1929\n\nStarting in 1938, Mk IVP and VP carriages were used for the new Ordnance QF 25-pounder Mk 1. This was a conversion from the 18-pounder Mk IV Ordnance. The calibre was increased from 84 mm to 87.6 mm by changing the liner.\n\n Spanish service \nthumb|left|105/30 modelo 1940 at the Historical Military Museum of Cartagena, front view\nAfter WWI, Vickers modified 18-pounder on the Mk. IV carriage to shoot 105-mm shells; this design was license-produced as Obús Vickers de 10,5 cm. modelo 1922 (105/22) at partially Vickers-owned Sociedad Española de Construcción Naval plant; those howitzers were used by both sides of the Spanish Civil War. After the start of WWII they were modernised with a lengthened (from 22 calibres to 30 calibres) barrel featuring a counterweight at the breech and redesignated as Obús de campaña Vickers de 105/30 modelo 1940 Some 105/30 pieces (but not all) received pneumatic wheels.\n\n Production \nBy the outbreak of war in 1914, 1225 guns had been produced, including 99 in India.Hogg UK production was by Armstrong Whitworth, Vickers and Woolwich Ordnance factory. During the First World War, these were joined by Beardmore, the Elswick Ordnance Company and, in the US, Bethlehem Steel. In the latter part of the war, component assemblies were produced by various other companies.\n\nTotal wartime production 1914–1918 was 9908 guns and 6926 carriages.The Official History of the Ministry of Munitions, Volume X, The Supply of Munitions, Part 1 Guns Limited production of both guns and carriages continued between the wars and some carriages for use with 25-pounder Mk 1 were produced in the early part of the Second World War.\n\nCombat use \n First World War \nthumb|\nThroughout the First World War, the 18-pounder was operated by the Royal Field Artillery as the standard field gun. Some Royal Horse Artillery batteries were also re-equipped with it as their 13-pounders proved unsuited to the prevalent trench warfare.\nthumb|left|\nThe gun and its 2-wheeled ammunition limber (carriage) were towed by a team of six vanner horses (light draught) in pairs – lead pair, centre pair, limber pair. A driver rode the left horse of each pair. The limber was hooked up to the horses and the trail of the gun was hooked up to the limber, so the total weight of the gun and trail were supported on 4 wheels. The gun detachment all rode into action either on their own horses or on the limber and wagons, led by the No. 1 (the detachment commander, a Sergeant) on his own horse.Clarke, pg. 46 In the early actions of the war, the ammunition wagon was positioned on the gun position to the left of the gun. The teams with their respective limbers, moving back from the gun position to the \"wagon lines\". Ammunition was passed from the wagon to the loader. As the war progressed and larger quantities of ammunition were fired, ammunition was often dumped directly onto the gun position next to the gun pits and the wagons held in the wagon lines.\n\nInitially, British Regular Army and Canadian infantry divisions were equipped with three field artillery brigades each with three batteries of six 18-pounders (for a total of 54 per division), and a brigade of 4.5-inch howitzers. By the end of September 1914, all reserve guns (25% above the establishment entitlements as decided by the Mowat Committee in 1901) had been delivered to France, although new production orders had been placed on the outbreak of war. However, there were insufficient guns to equip brigades of New Army, Territorial Force and other Dominion divisions, so their batteries had only four guns (total 36 per division) and at Gallipoli, Australian and New Zealand divisions had fewer brigades.David Horner, \"The Gunners – A History of Australian Artillery\", 1995, Chapter 5 In 1916, the decision was taken on the Western Front that all batteries should have six guns.\n\nFrom February 1917, all divisions were standardised with two artillery brigades each with three batteries (named A, B and C) of six 18-pounders (total 36 per division) and one battery (D) of six 4.5-inch howitzers (total 12 per division). The remaining 18 guns from Regular divisions were transferred to Army control in Army Field Artillery Brigades, to be available for more flexible deployment.\n\n 1914 \nthumb|\nWhen the war began, British field guns (13-pounder and 18-pounder) were equipped solely with shrapnel shells, with an approximate 3:1 ratio of field guns to field howitzers (5-inch and 4.5-inch).\n\nThe 18-pounder shrapnel shell contained 374 small spherical bullets. A time fuze was set to initiate the shell in the air in front of the target. This blew off the shell nose and fired the bullets forward in a cone like a shotgun – they were effective up to 300 yards from the burst. For maximum effect from the cone of bullets, the angle of descent of the shell had to be flat and not plunging. At a theoretical maximum 20 rounds per minute, it could deliver 7,480 bullets per minute at a far greater range than machine guns. The gunners and officers of Regular Army field artillery batteries were expert at closely supporting the \"fire and movement\" tactics of the infantry with accurate shrapnel fire.\n\nShrapnel was effective against troops in the open, including those serving guns without gun shields. They remained effective throughout the war against opportunity targets, such as working parties. They were used for wire cutting and most importantly in the creeping barrage, where they prevented defenders from manning their trench parapets during a British assault. In this respect, they were perhaps the key element in the British artillery doctrine of neutralizing defenders during an assault instead of trying to destroy the enemy in their defences before an attack. Primacy of neutralizing defenders became the distinguishing characteristic of British artillery for the remainder of the 20th century.\n\nThe first trial high-explosive TNT rounds were fired in action on 31 October 1914 by 70th Battery, 34th Brigade RFA and 54th Battery, 39th Brigade RFA on the Ypres front and were quite successful, demonstrating both that they could destroy enemy guns and kill troops. From then on, Britain increasingly supplied 18-pounders with high-explosive shells.\n\nA major lesson learned in 1914 was that the early British doctrine of positioning field guns in open or semi-open positions made them vulnerable to enemy artillery fire, and subsequently more use would be made of available sheltered and hidden positions for firing. This made the role of the Observing Officer crucial for 18-pounder batteries engaging targets as they could no longer rely on direct line of sight.Farndale 1986, pg. 332 These officers suffered high casualties. It is instructive to compare the photograph of the 18-pounder gun in the open at the 1914 Battle of the Marne with that below of the gun almost hidden in a pit at the Second Battle of Bullecourt in 1917.\n\n 1915 \nthumb|\nWith Britain now attacking on the Western Front from 1915 onwards, barrages were used to neutralize defenders during an attack (first used some 15 years earlier). 18-pounder fire was also used to cut enemy barbed-wire obstacles, and high-explosive shells to inflict damage on defensive works. From 1916, light and medium mortars were increasingly used to blow aside barbed wire obstacles.\n\nThe 18-pounder continued to be used as a general-purpose light gun in other theatres, such as on Gallipoli where it was manhandled up onto the tops of steep hills such as the \"400 Plateau\", \"Bolton's Hill\" and \"Russell's Top\"CEW Bean describes this in detail in \"THE OFFICIAL HISTORY OF AUSTRALIA IN THE WAR OF 1914–1918 Volume II\" Chapter 3. 11th Edition, published by Angus & Robertson, Sydney, 1941  because of the lack of a modern mountain gun and shortage of field howitzers. The 18-pounder could attack lightly protected troops by destroying the parapets of trenches, small houses, and barricades. But its relatively flat high velocity trajectory meant that it could not reach an enemy sheltering out of the direct line of sight, in dips in the ground, on reverse slopes (such as the Quadrilateral east of Ginchy on the Somme) or in deep trenches or cellars. It lacked the power to demolish fortifications. However, it could neutralize defenders with HE or shrapnel.\n\nNevertheless, in the first 10 months of the war, 3628 18-pounders were ordered and only 530 4.5-inch Howitzers. Heavier guns were being collected from the farthest corners of the Empire and by June 1915 orders had been placed for 274 new heavy guns and howitzers from 60-pounder Gun to 15-inch Howitzer and a new 6-inch Howitzer designed. However, by June 1915 it had also become clear that Germany was reducing the proportion of field guns (to 3.5 per 1000 bayonets) and increasing that of heavier guns and howitzers (to 1.7 per 1000 bayonets), with one-third of their artillery being 15 cm or more.Official History of the Ministry of Munitions Volume X Part I pg 7 Britain had no choice but to increase the amount of heavy artillery, but did not plan to reduce the scale of field artillery because of the need for what would later be called \"close support\". Nevertheless, a de facto decrease had happened due to expansion limiting field batteries to 4 guns.\n\nBritish planners considered that they would need a 2:1 ratio for a successful offensive, while the French believed they needed 1:1.Farndale 1986, pg. 116 General Farndale justified the retention of 2:1 field artillery as \"Field guns were essential to attack targets close to our own troops and to play their part in the tactical plan\".Farndale 1986, pg. 333\n\nDuring 1915, 18-pounder ammunition production was equally divided between HE and shrapnel, but expenditure was mostly shrapnel, 88% in September and November.Official History of the Ministry of Munitions Volume X Part II Gun Ammunition: General\n\n 1916 \nthumb|left|\nField artillery (both 18-pounder and 4.5-inch howitzer) was used successfully during the pre-Zero fire in the Battle of the Somme in late June – early July 1916, when the British heavy artillery damaged German defensive works and forced troops into the open to rebuild them they were successfully fired on with shrapnel.Farndale 1986, pg. 144 The use of field guns to provide a covering fire barrage that neutralized the enemy during the infantry advance was used and improved during the Battle of the Somme, forcing the enemy to remain in shelters while the infantry advanced immediately behind the bursting shells – \"... It is therefore of the first importance that in all cases the infantry must advance right under the field artillery barrage, which must not uncover the first objective until the infantry is within 50 yards of it\".Farndale 1986, pg/ 150. Quoting MGRA Fourth Army Major-General Birch's memorandum during the battle. The small bursting range of the shell was an advantage in this case, as advancing troops could approach close to it. The 18-pounder's role was spelled out following the Somme battles \"... primarily in barrage fire, repelling attacks in the open, raking communications, wire cutting and sometimes for neutralising guns within their reach, destroying breast-works and barriers with HE and preventing repair work on defenses beyond the reach of infantry weapons\".Farndale 1986, pg. 158. Quoting War Office Artillery Notes No. 4 – Artillery in Offensive Operations, January 1917.\n\n18-pounder ammunition requirements were predominantly shrapnel during 1916, although in the latter part of the year it shifted back to equality between HE and shrapnel. In July 1916, standard contract prices for UK produced shells were 12 shillings and 6 pence (62.5 pence in modern terms) for HE and 18 shillings and 6 pence for shrapnel. US and Canadian prices were significantly higher. The lowest price achieved for 18-pounder HE shells was 8 shillings and 11 pence (44.8 pence) later in 1916.Official History of the Ministry of Munitions Volume X Part III Gun Ammunition: Shell Manufacture\n\n 1917 \nthumb|\nThe January 1917 \"Artillery in Offensive Operations\" estimated that 18-pounders needed 7.5 shrapnel rounds + 5% HE per yard of front at medium range to cut barbed wire defences, and 20 rounds of HE to destroy trenches in enfilade. The destruction of trenches frontally was generally estimated as requiring twice the enfilade amount. It was estimated that an 18-pounder would fire 200 rounds per day in an \"all-out\" offensive.\"Artillery in Offensive Operations\", Appendix IV, January 1917 It expressed a preference for shrapnel with a long corrector in creeping barrages due to its high number of \"man-killing missiles\" and its smoke cloud (shrapnel shells were designed to produce a white puff of smoke on bursting, originally as an aid to gunnery spotting). HE was viewed as not providing this necessary visual screen but could be considered for use in creeping and back-barrages in conjunction with smoke shell, but smoke shell was considered \"still in its infancy\".\"Artillery in Offensive Operations\", 13. Ammunition for the Field Artillery Barrage, January 1917\n\nIn its February 1917 Technical Notes on 18-pounder Barrages, GHQ stated shrapnel and HE barrages would normally cover to a depth of 200 yards and expressed its preference for timed shrapnel (T.S.) for creeping barrages, due partly to shrapnel directing its force forward hence being safer for those following, especially if it fell short. 50% air bursts and 50% percussion (bursting on contact) was considered optimal except on \"very bad ground\" where percussion rounds would mostly be wasted. HE with its lateral bursting was considered more dangerous to advancing troops (as they were assumed to be in a line abreast) than shrapnel if it burst short, but lateral bursts were considered to have less effect on the enemy as they had less \"forward effect\". HE with delay was difficult for advancing troops to stay close behind, as it burst 30–40 yards beyond the point of initial contact. HE without delay was assessed as effective only if it burst actually in the enemy trench. With a proper barrage program and fuze setting, timed shrapnel creeping barrage was considered optimal.Technical notes on 18-pounder Barrages. February 1917. British regular army field gunners were already proficient in accurately timed low shrapnel bursts in 1914, as demonstrated in the early battles, but few remained by early 1917 and many gunners were relatively new recruits and inexperienced; HE had only been in use with 18-pounders for two years, so this note perhaps reflects a desire to stick with a proven method for which they could still draw on a nucleus of experts. Shrapnel appears to have been favoured for creeping barrages and a mix of shrapnel and HE for standing barrages and other tasks.\n\nThe British advance in pursuit of the German army in early 1917 as it withdrew to stronger positions on the Hindenburg Line brought a brief resumption of mobile warfare, and from the experience GHQ emphasised the need to get all light weaponry as far forward as possible to support infantry, and that \"Covering fire of 18-pounders and 4.5-inch howitzers can not be too far exploited\" [i.e. should be exploited as much as possible]. It also warned \"There was tendency, due to trench warfare, among C.R.A.s to attempt to control individual batteries. Brigade or group commanders should be given a task and allowed to carry it out\".Additional Points Brought Out in Open Fighting up to 7 April 1917.\n\nthumb|\nthumb|\nAt the opening of the Battle of Arras on 9 April 1917, the order was for 18-pounders to fire 50% HE and 50% shrapnel in the creeping barrage ahead of the advancing infantry, with one gun for every 20 yards of front. While a few commanders varied this slightly, such as Brigadier-General Tudor, CRA of 9th (Scottish) Division, who chose 75% HE and 25% smoke, the opening was notable for the first use of a coordinated fireplan across the whole front of several armies, with a common strategy linking infantry with artillery and coordinating the advance of various types of artillery. For instance, the 18-pounders were to move forward when the infantry reached their Phase 2 objective and the 60-pounders and 6-inch howitzers would move forward to take their vacated firing positions. This contrasted with the Somme, where individual Corps and Division commanders used their own fire plans and assault tactics.Farndale 1986, pg. 166, 171-172\n\nFor the Third Battle of Ypres in July 1917, the plan was for wire cutting to be done by mortars and howitzers, \"to conceal the strength of the field guns\". 1,098 18-pounders, one for every 15 yards on average,Farndale 1986, pg. 199 would include shrapnel in firing a creeping barrage starting close to the British trenches and moving forward at 100 yards in 4 minutes. Field batteries were to advance beyond no-mans land as the priority was to protect the infantry while they were \"consolidating on their objectives\" (i.e. gaining and holding new advanced positions).Farndale 1986, pg. 197. Quoting the plan issued by Major-General Uniacke, MGRA 5th Army on 30 June 1917.\n\nIn the opening barrage for the first phase on 31 July, the Battle of Pilckem Ridge, 2/3s of the 18-pounders fired in the creeping barrage at four rounds per minute and 1/3 fired in the standing barrage on the German second line.Farndale 1986, pg. 201 The barrage was generally successful; but as the weather deteriorated, tracks turned to mud and shell holes filled with water, it became nearly impossible for guns to advance in support of the infantry as planned.Farndale 1986, pg. 203\n\nFor the opening barrage at the Battle of Menin Road on 20 September, the ratio of medium/heavy artillery to field artillery reached 1 : 1.5 for the first time, reflecting more heavy guns rather than fewer field guns. 18-pounders were to fire 50%-50% shrapnel and HE with 25% of the HE fuzes set to delay.Farndale 1986, pg. 205-206 Hence the previous doubts about HE appear to have been overcome, and for the lifting barrage for the Battle of Cambrai on 20 November (this was chosen rather than a creeping barrage) the 18-pounders were to fire equal proportions of shrapnel, HE and smoke, with the precise smoke usage depending on weather conditions at the time.Farndale 1986, pg. 219\n\nA total of 47,992,000 18-pounder rounds were manufactured in 1917 and 38,068,000 were fired,Farndale 1986, pg. 206 (38% of its total for the whole war) indicating the extent to which the artillery war escalated in 1917. 18-pounder ammunition requirements in 1917 were generally equal quantities of shrapnel and HE.\n\n 1918 \n18-pounders were used effectively in the spring of 1918 against attacking German troops during their Spring Offensive. However, the effectiveness of the German fire plan on 21 March caused many casualties amongst the gunners, and in too many cases batteries were unable to withdraw before being overrun. Nevertheless, on 4 April, the Germans made their final attempt to break the British line having advanced to the area of Villers Bretonneux held by 14th (Light) and 18th (Eastern) Divisions, reinforced by the 16th (Irish) and 39th divisional artilleries although batteries were understrength through losses. By mid-morning, observers were engaging massed German infantry but these pressed forward and reached just east of Hamel. Brigadier-General Edward Harding-Newman, CRA of 14th (Light) Division issued the following order \"This attack must and can be stopped by artillery fire. If any battery can no longer effectively stop the enemy from its present position, it will at once move forward to a position on the crest, to engage the enemy over open sights. It is essential that the artillery hold the line and they will do so.\" Fire from several RFA brigades, mostly with 18-pounder batteries, stopped the German advance, including some from 16th (Irish) Division that deployed forward to the crest and observers from the 177th Brigade RFA using Hamel church tower. This action effectively ended the German advance.Farndale 1986, pg. 277-279\n\nFor the successful British attack at the Battle of Amiens on 4 July, there was one 18-pounder per 25 yards of front, supplemented by machine guns, and they fired a barrage of 60% shrapnel, 30% HE and 10% smoke 200 yards ahead of the advancing troops.Farndale 1986, pg. 284\n\nIn the first half of 1918, 18-pounder ammunition requirements were predominantly (about 60%) shrapnel, moving back to equality between shrapnel and HE in the final months of the war. Chemical and smoke shells were each around 5% of the total.\n\nBy the end of the war, the modern \"empty battlefield\" was evolving, with troops learning to avoid open spaces, and the light field gun was becoming obsolete, with an increasing use of light machine guns, light mortars and field howitzers which, with their high trajectory, were able to drop shells onto even deeply sheltered enemy troops on reverse slopes that field guns could not reach. The 18-pounder Mk IV, with its box trail which allowed it to fire in a high trajectory, had begun its evolution into the more versatile 25-pounder gun-howitzer.\n\nAt the Armistice, there were 3,162 18-pounders in service on the Western Front, which had fired approximately 99,397,670 rounds, and 800 guns in Egypt, Russia and on other fronts.\n\n Between The Wars \nAfter the Armistice in 1918, some British and Canadian 18-pounders, including a battery transported portee, were in the British Army of the Rhine in the Rhineland. It also served with British and Canadian forces in North Russia in 1918–1919 and with the Canadian Siberian Expeditionary Force.HughesColonel G. W. L. Nicholson, The Gunners of Canada – The History of the Royal Regiment of Canadian Artillery, Volume 1 1534–1919, 1967\n\nIn 1919, it served with the 7th, 16th, 21st and 217th Brigades R.F.A. in the Third Afghan War,General Staff Branch, Army HQ India, \"The Third Afghan War 1919 Official Account\", 1926 in operations in Mesopotamia 1920–21, and Waziristan 1936–37.\n\n Second World War \nthumb|An 18-pounder Mk. IIPA gun being inspected by General Georges at Orchies in April 1940\nDuring the Second World War, the 18-pounder was used mainly by Territorial Army regiments in the British Expeditionary Force. Some Regular units were also equipped with them, including K (Hondeghem) Battery, which won its battle honour with them. A total of 216 guns were lost in the 1940 campaign. This left the British Army with 126 guns in UK and 130 in the rest of the world, according to a stocktake in July 1940.\n\nIt was also used by British and other Commonwealth units in the East African campaign,Farndale 1996Northling, Commandant CJ, Ultima Ratio Regum – Artillery History of South Africa, 1987 and the North African campaign.\n\nDuring the war against Japan (from December 1941), the 18-pdr was used in the Malayan campaign (by a number of British field regiments) and, to a lesser degree, the Battle of Hong Kong (by 965 Beach Defence Battery).Farndale 2002 At the Battle of Kota Bharu (Malaya) some of the first shots of the Pacific War were fired by an Indian Army 18-pounder. Most, if not all, of these guns were lost as a result of the defeat of Commonwealth forces and the capture of Hong Kong and Singapore. \n\nFrom 1942, the 25-pdr replaced the 18-pdr for British and Indian forces in the Burma campaign.\n\n Irish Service \nThe 18-pounder was introduced to the Irish National Army in 1922 on the foundation of the state. It was first used by National Army Gunners to bombard the Four Courts in Dublin from 28 June 1922, as part of the Battle of Dublin. The departing British Forces were criticised for the lack of training that they had imparted to the gunners of the infant Irish artillery corps, and for providing shells intended to destroy barbed wire rather than the normal HE shells. The marks of the shell fire can still be seen on the walls of the Four Courts. The 18-pounder played an important role throughout the Irish Civil War, being instrumental in the fighting in Munster alongside the Rolls-Royce Armoured Car. The nine 18-pounder guns were used in the infantry support role until grouped together to form an artillery corps in March 1923.\n\nWith the establishment of the Defence Forces in 1924, the 18-pounder was the only artillery weapon in Irish service, forming the 1st and 2nd Field Batteries of the Artillery Corps. By the following year, twenty five 18-pounder guns were on hand and three more were delivered in 1933. Additional equipment received by the army in 1941 included four 18-pounder guns. The regular army's field batteries re-equipped with the 25-pounder in 1949 but thirty seven 18-pounder guns were still in use with the reserve FCA. The guns remained in FCA service until the late 1970s, when they were replaced by the 25-pounder and 120 mm mortars.\n\nSome examples remain preserved, including several in Collins Barracks, Cork, in McKee Barracks, Dublin and two Mk IV guns in Aiken Barracks, Dundalk.\n\n Finnish Service \nIn 1940 Britain sold 30 Mk 2 guns on Mk 2PA carriages to Finland during the Winter War, but they arrived too late to be used during that combat. They were used as \"84 K/18\" during the Continuation War by Field Artillery Regiment 8, 17th Division. They were modified by the Finns who fitted a large muzzle brake and a much improved sighting system. For use in deep snow a second set of  wheels were fitted.\n\nExtended specification \nthumb|\n Gun\n Length: \n weight: 9 cwt\n Rifling: 18 grooves (Mks I, II, IV)\n Twist: 1 in 30 (Mks I, II, IV)\n Barrel Life: 12,000 to 15,000 rounds\n Carriage\n weight: 24 cwt (Mk V 27 cwt)\n Width: \n recoil: 41 inches fixed (carriage Mk I, II); 26 – 48 inches variable (carriage Mk IV, Mk V)\n Elevation: -5° to +16° (carriage Mk I & II with pole trail), +30° (carriage Mk III box trail), +37°\n(carriage Mk IV box trail & Mk V split trail)\n Traverse: 4.5° left and right (Carriage Mk I – IV); 25° left and right (carriage Mk V)\n Gunshield: proof against shrapnel and rifle fire (500 yds)\n Limber\n Capacity: 24 shells\n weight: 14 cwt\n\nFirst World War Ammunition \n18-pounder ammunition was a fixed round (i.e. the shell and brass cartridge case were loaded as a single unit, much like a large rifle cartridge), and fitted with a nose fuze. The normal service round was \"Full Charge\", a \"Reduced Charge\" round was available for training. Double base propellant (nitroglycerine and nitrocellulose) was used, Cordite Mark 1 was the standard propellant when the gun was first introduced into service. By 1914, this cordite had been replaced by Cordite MD. During the First World War this was replaced by a revised formulation that was easier to produce called Cordite RDB.Official History of the Ministry of Munitions, Volume X The Supply of Munitions, Part IV Gun Ammunition: Explosives\n\nUntil September 1914, the only 18-pounder issued shell was shrapnel, fitted with a No. 80 \"Time & Percussion\" fuze (based on a Krupp design). The timer was set to open the shell and fire the bullets forward before it hit the ground. No 80 Fuze was an igniferous type of time fuze (as were most First World War time fuzes), meaning that it burnt gunpowder at a known rate to give a time from firing to fuze functioning. The shell did not burst, but projected spherical lead-antimony bullets forward in a cone, these bullets were effective up to 300 yards from the burst. 18-pounder carried 374 of the 41/pound size bullets. The fuze was designed to function as close as 50 yards from the muzzle if required, in order to eliminate the need for case shot. Observing shrapnel bursts was difficult and, after many experiments, gunpowder pellets were added to the tube between the fuze and the gunpowder ejecting charge in the base of the shell in order to emit a puff of smoke, this had the added advantage of widening the cone of the bullet spread.\n\nA star shell with a time fuze (No 25) had been developed and small stocks were held before the war but it was not routine issue.\n\nPre-war experiments with 18-pounder HE shells had been inconclusive in terms of their benefits. However, the first month of the war showed that they were worth having and the first HE rounds arrived in September 1914. This was a different shape to the existing shrapnel shell so a new Mark 2 shrapnel shell was introduced to ensure ballistic compatibility. The original shrapnel shells had a relatively blunt ogive – 1.5 circular radius head (crh), the newer ones were 2 crh.\n\nIn 1914, the standard HE used by UK artillery was Lyddite, a formulation based on picric acid, this was a powerful explosive but expensive. TNT was introduced, but this too was expensive, particularly in its pure form required for shells so eventually Amatol was adopted. This was a mixture of ammonium nitrate and lower quality TNT, various proportions were used but eventually 80% ammonium nitrate and 20% TNT became standard. The parallel inside walls of the shell made it suitable for filling using pre-formed blocks of explosive as well as pouring.Official History of the Ministry of Munitions, Volume X The Supply of Munitions, Part II Gun Ammunition: General\n\nOther types of shell were also introduced, although not as extensively as they were for howitzers and heavier guns. White phosphorus smoke shells became available in small quantities in 1916, and in 1918 chemical and incendiary shells were provided. The latter was a shrapnel type shell using thermite pellets, although a black powder incendiary shell for AA use against Zeppelins was introduced in 1916.Official History of the Ministry of Munitions, Volume X The Supply of Munitions, Part III Gun Ammunition: Shell Manufacture\n center|200px center center 140px|center 46px|center 50px|center\n\nSecond World War Ammunition \nthumb|right|18-pounder rounds in British service in 1939. 'Reduced' means a reduced propelling charge. Older rounds were also available. Fuze No 115 was a streamlined version of No 106. Armour-piercing shell had a base fuze, No 12\nAfter the First World War, the variety of ammunition was reduced, although an armour piercing HE shell was developed. The main change was introduction of a new streamlined HE shell, 4/7.5 crh, giving a significant improvement in range. In the 1930s, the new generation of double base propellant, Cordite W, was also adopted.",

Marítimo in the middle of 2005, aged 20. He scored once in his first season, in a 2–0 home win over neighbours C.D. Nacional on 16 April 2006, but played only eight league matches.\n\nIn the following three years, Olberdam continued to be regularly used by the Madeira side, amassing a further 66 games and netting two goals. On 2 February 2010, he was loaned to league leaders S.C. Braga until June as the team had just lost to a hefty suspension another player in the position, compatriot Vandinho; he helped with three appearances for an eventual best-ever second-place finish.\n\nIn July 2010, Olberdam returned to his country, signing with Club Athletico Paranaense on loan. In the following transfer window, he joined FC Rapid București from Romania in the same situation.",

    "clean_text": "Lauw Ho (; died in 1863), also spelled Lauw Houw, was a prominent tax farmer (pachter), tycoon and ancestor of the Lauw-Sim-Zecha family, part of the 'Cabang Atas' gentry of the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia). \n\nBetween 1845 and 1861, Lauw held various pachten or revenue farms, including for pawn houses, slaughterhouses, fish and – in particular – for gambling, over which he intermittently acted as Hoofdpachter or head revenue farmer. The pacht or revenue farm was a system of tax collection, in which the Dutch colonial authorities outsourced tax collection to the highest bidding revenue farmers. Together with Gouw Kang Soei, Tan Ling, Khouw Siong Bo and Tan Kong Boen, Lauw was also part of the Ngo Ho Tjiang partnership or kongsi, which dominated the opium pacht – the most lucrative of all the revenue farms. The proceeds from revenue farming made Lauw one of the wealthiest tycoons in the Dutch East Indies. \n\nDespite his vast wealth, Lauw's application for an honorary appointment as Luitenant-titulair der Chinezen did not succeed, probably because, as a newly-rich man, he did not come from an established family of Chinese officers. The Chinese officership was a very prestigious and senior civil government post in the Dutch colonial bureaucracy: appointments tended to be doled out on a near-hereditary basis to a small number of interrelated families - the so-called Cabang Atas gentry. Lauw did, however, serve in the bureaucracy in a lesser capacity as Wijkmeester, or ward master, of Meester Cornelis. Before Lauw died in 1863, however, he had the satisfaction of seeing his two sons, Lauw Tek Kang and Lauw Tek Lok, raised to the Chinese officership on December 23, 1854 as Luitenants der Chinezen, of their father's old district of Meester Cornelis and neighbouring Bekasi respectively. These appointments signalled the elevation of Lauw's family to the ranks of the Cabang Atas. Through Luitenant Lauw Tek Lok, Lauw Ho is the great-great-grandfather of the hotelier Adrian Lauw-Zecha, founder of Aman Resorts.",

This could result in the early development of arcus lipoides, hazy corneal limbus, and hyperopia. Cornea plana 1 is an autosomal dominant disorder.\n\nSigns and symptoms\nCornea plana commonly presents as a flat cornea, early-onset arcus lipoides, low anterior chamber depth, and an indistinct border between the sclera and cornea due to a decreased angle between the two. Although a small corneal diameter is anticipated, measuring it can be challenging because the scleral tissue overlaps the cornea by a few millimeters. In the patients who have been described, the anterior chamber depth has been found to vary from 0.8 to 2.1 mm.\n\nMoreover, high hyperopia, strabismus, microcornea, posterior embryotoxon, iridocorneal adhesions, iris lumps, iris wasting, and pupillary abnormalities can all be present. Instead of hyperopia, myopia has been identified in a few cases. As many as 90 percent of cases have a bilateral presentation, which is linked to sclerocornea. Finally, congenital ptosis has also been reported, and the absence of corneal protrusion is most likely the cause.\n\nDiagnosis\nClinical presentation, keratometry, pachymetry, and endothelial imaging are used to make the diagnosis.\n\nSince the decreased refraction in the autosomal recessive form is more severe than in the autosomal dominant form, corneal refraction measurements can be used to differentiate between CNA1 and CNA2.\n\nHistology is distinguished by acanthosis, keratinization of the corneal epithelium, Bowman's membrane defects, and stromal vascularization and scar formation.",

She has a Bachelor of Laws degree, from Makerere University, Uganda's oldest and largest public university. She also holds a Diploma in Legal Practice, awarded by the Law Development Centre in Kampala, the national capital and largest city in the country.\n\nCareer\nPrior to her appointment to the high court, she was an officer in the Uganda Ministry of Justice and Constitutional Affairs. In 2016, following her appointment to the high court, she was assigned to the Land Division of the court.\n\nOther considerations\nMs. Katunguka has been involved in several public investigations, tribunals and commissions of inquiry, including the following:\n(a) In 2007, she served as the registrar of the Electricity Disputes Tribunal, an organ of the Judiciary of Uganda. (b) In 2010, she was appointed as the Secretary of the judicial commission established to investigate the alleged misuse of funds in the Universal Primary Education (UPE) and Universal Secondary Education (USE) government programmes. That commission's work was terminated by parliament, before the commission finished its work, because the investigation was using up too much of the national resources. In 2016, she was appointed as the vice chairperson of the nine-member Makerere University Visitation Committee, to inquire into the affairs of the University. The report of that committee was made public on 29 December 2017.",

    "clean_text": "Steven Jeffrey Taylor (born 18 October 1955) is an English former footballer. A forward, he scored 157 goals in 441 league games in a 15-year career in the Football League.\n\nHe began his career at Bolton Wanderers, turning professional in October 1973. He was loaned out to Port Vale in October 1975, before signing with Oldham Athletic in October 1977 for £38,000. He transferred to Luton Town in January 1979 for a £75,000 fee before moving on to Mansfield Town for the same fee a few months later. He signed with Burnley in 1980, and helped the \"Clarets\" to the Third Division title in 1981–82. He switched to Wigan Athletic in 1983 before spending a brief spell with Stockport County the following year. He was signed by Rochdale in November 1984 and had a prolific two-year spell at the club before he was bought by Preston North End for £20,000. He quickly returned to Burnley and featured in the 1988 Football League Trophy final. He returned to Rochdale for the 1988–89 campaign before he retired from professional football. He later had an unsuccessful time as manager of Northern Premier League club Mossley in 1993.\n\nPlaying career\nTaylor was an apprentice with Bolton Wanderers and turned professional in October 1973, with the \"Trotters\" lying in the Second Division under the stewardship of Jimmy Armfield. He joined Roy Sproson's Port Vale on loan in October 1975. It took until 1 November for him to earn his Third Division debut for the \"Valiants\"; a 1–0 win over Rotherham United at Vale Park. Seven days later he scored a brace past Sheffield Wednesday in a 3–0 victory at Hillsborough Stadium. Upon his return to Burnden Park, he helped new boss Ian Greaves to take Wanderers to a fourth-place finish in 1975–76 – they were just one point off Bristol City and West Bromwich Albion, who were both promoted. Bolton again finished fourth in 1976–77, lying just one point behind promoted Nottingham Forest.\n\nIn October 1977, Taylor signed for his hometown club Oldham Athletic for a fee of £38,000. He finished as the club's top scorer in 1977–78 with 21 goals; the \"Latics\" enjoyed a good season under Jimmy Frizzell, and finished eighth in the Second Division. Taylor then left Boundary Park and moved to Luton Town in January 1979 for a £75,000 fee. The \"Hatters\" finished two places and two points above the Second Division relegation zone in 1978–79. Taylor only hit one goal in 20 league games at Kenilworth Road. David Pleat sold Taylor on to Mansfield Town, again for £75,000. He could not prevent Mick Jones's \"Stags\" from occupying one of the Third Division relegation places in 1979–80, and did not stay on for long at Field Mill.\n\nTaylor was then signed by Brian Miller's Burnley. He scored a hat-trick past Millwall in a 5–0 win at Turf Moor on 27 September 1980, and finished as the club's top scorer in 1980–81 with 17 goals in 47 games. He then hit 14 goals in 31 appearances in 1981–82, as the club finished as champions of the Third Division. He scored a hat-trick past Sheffield Wednesday in a 4–1 win on 1 January 1983, and another hat-trick past Charlton Athletic in a 7–1 home win on 26 February. He hit 15 goals in 41 appearances in 1982–83, though this was not enough to save the club from relegation.\n\nHe joined Third Division rivals Wigan Athletic for the 1983–84 season and finished as the club's top scorer with 10 goals. Harry McNally did not keep Taylor on at Springfield Park, and he instead started the 1984–85 campaign in the Fourth Division with Eric Webster's Stockport County. His stay at Edgeley Park was brief, and Taylor joined up with Vic Halom at Rochdale in November 1984 and scored 14 goals in 33 games in 1984–85. He then finished as the Fourth Division's joint-top scorer (with Southend United's Richard Cadette) in 1985–86 with 25 league goals. Seven goals in 13 games at the start of the 1986–87 season saw him snapped up by John McGrath at Preston North End for £20,000. The \"Lilywhites\" went on to win promotion out of the Fourth Division, but Taylor only featured in five league games at Deepdale. He remained in the Fourth Division and returned to Burnley after former boss Brian Miller was re-appointed as manager. He hit six goals in 54 games in 1987–88 and featured in the 1988 Football League Trophy final at Wembley, which ended in a 2–0 defeat to Wolverhampton Wanderers. He made four appearances in 1988–89 before returning to Spotland. He hit four goals in 17 league appearances in his second spell for \"Dale\", and left the Football League in summer 1989.\n\nManagerial career\nAfter over four years out of the game, Taylor was appointed manager of Northern Premier League\nDivision One side Mossley in August 1993. He left after just one win in 13 games. While manager of Mossley, he played four times, scoring once. The club went on to finish the 1993–94 season in 17th place.\n\nCareer statistics\nSource:\n\n+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competitionClubSeasonLeagueFA CupOtherTotalDivisionAppsGoalsAppsGoalsAppsGoalsAppsGoalsBolton Wanderers1974–75Second Division500000501975–76Second Division300000301976–77Second Division31161010442201977–78Second Division10004050Total4016101445520Port Vale (loan)1975–76Third Division42000042Oldham Athletic1977–78Second Division3220210034211978–79Second Division1550082237Total472521825728Luton Town1978–79Second Division2010000201Mansfield Town1979–80Third Division37730834810Burnley1980–81Third Division3816207147171981–82Third Division229435031121982–83Second Division261272714015Total863713519211844Wigan Athletic1983–84Third Division30743303710Stockport County1983–84Fourth Division12600001261984–85Fourth Division1421142195Total26811423111Rochdale1984–85Fourth Division3012003233141985–86Fourth Division4525453152311986–87Fourth Division951042147Total8442551059952Preston North End1986–87Fourth Division52000052Burnley1987–88Fourth Division426101105461988–89Fourth Division30001040Total45610120586Rochdale1988–89Fourth Division1740000174Career total44115729157918549190\n\nHonours\nBurnley\nFootball League Third Division: 1981–82\nFootball League Trophy runner-up: 1988\n\nPreston North End\nFootball League Fourth Division second-place promotion: 1986–87",

    "clean_text": "Animal is a 2018 Argentine-Spanish drama thriller film directed by Armando Bó II, starring Guillermo Francella and Carla Peterson. Animal was partially funded by Argentina's National Institute of Cinema and Audiovisual Arts (INCAA).\n\nPlot\nAntonio Decoud, a family man and manager of a meat processing plant, lives a wealthy life in an upper-class neighborhood in Mar del Plata. His polite lifestyle is shaken by an unexpected illness. Decoud will be forced to fight on unknown ground in order to find an organ donor. Meanwhile, Elías Montero and his pregnant wife Lucy Villar, a homeless couple, see an opportuniy to change their lives by extorting money from Decoud.\n\nCast \n\n Guillermo Francella... Antonio Decoud\n Carla Peterson... Susana Decoud\n Federico Salles... Elías Montero\n Mercedes De Santis... Lucy Villar\n Gloria Carrá... Josefina Hertz\n Marcelo Subiotto... Gabriel Hertz\n Majo Chicar... Linda Decoud\n Joaquín Flammini... Tomás Decoud\n\nReception \nEzequiel Boetti from Otros Cines says that Bo made an essay on cruelty, selfishness, contempt and class conflict. Ambito Financiero's Paraná Sendrós praises Francella's characterization of Decoud, and describes the movie as a satire on the fragile nature of relationships and fortune. Gaspar Zimerman from Clarín compares Animal with Cape Fear, as both films are \"fictional experiments\" that confront a scared bourgeois with an out-of-control underclass. Tobias Dunschen from Critique Film observes the lack of a dramatic counterweight to the flashy treatment of Decoud's frenzied search for a life-saving organ. The Spanish critic Arantxa Acosta, from La Realidad no Existe, called the film \"terrifying\" because it inspires empathy for the two antagonists, Decoud and Montero, no matter how low they can fall.\n\nAccolades \nAnimal competed in the following film festivals:\n\n Chicago International Film Festival\n Busan International Film Festival\n Fajr Film Festival\n Le Roche-sur-Yon Festival\n Sitges Film Festival",

    "title": "Improvement Science Research Network",
    "clean_text": "The Improvement Science Research Network (ISRN) is a research network for academics and physicians who are conducting studies in the new medical field of improvement science.\n\nFounded in 2009, ISRN is part of the Institute for Integration of Medicine and Science at the University of Texas Health Science Center San Antonio (UTHSCSA).  It is housed in the UTHSCSA School of Nursing.  The principal investigator is Kathleen R. Stevens, EdD, MS, RN, ANEF, FAAN). ISRN is supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) through funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.\n\nISRN Membership is open to  healthcare researchers, academic and clinical scientists, clinicians, clinical leaders, administrators, and those with a specific interest in patient safety and improvement research.\n\nServices \nISRN provides a national laboratory for investigators from across broad geographical range to study improvement, healthcare delivery systems, dissemination, implementation, translation, safety, and patient outcomes.\n\nISRN infrastructure supports virtual collaboration in the conduct of network studies through direct engagement of study partners and sites, network study principal investigators, and centralized support. ISRN is registered with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality as an active PBRN.\n\nImprovement science\nimprovement science is an emerging field that shares common aspects with implementation science, translational science, healthcare delivery science, and knowledge translation. These fields are similar in their focus on transforming what is learned from research into common practice to improve care processes and outcomes. \"Improvement science\" is proposed as the most inclusive term in this list and is proposed as a specialty within health services research.\n\nTerminology\nThe ISRN framework and the Stevens Star Model of Knowledge Transformation (Stevens, 2015) are reflected in an international effort to create common terminology of organizational interventions for implementing best evidence-based practices into health practices, systems and policies.\n\nTo date, this effort resulted in development of a simplified model of interventions to promote and integrate evidence into health practices, systems, and policies (Colquhoun, et al., 2013) and a review of classification schemes for these interventions (Lokker, C., et al., 2015).\n\nResearch priorities\nISRN has established national stakeholder consensus on research priorities that distinguish it from other practice-based research networks (Stevens & Ovretveit, 2013). These priorities highlight gaps in improvement knowledge as identified by clinical and academic scholars, leaders, and change agents across major healthcare disciplines. The research priorities guide decisions about the direction of ISRN discovery and dissemination efforts toward ISRN-sponsored knowledge in each of the following domains of improvement science:\n\n Coordination and Transitions of Care – this category emphasizes strategies for improvement to care processes in specific clinical conditions. At this time, care coordination and transitions of care are the key clinical focus. Examples of Research Issues: Team performance, medication reconciliation, discharge for prevention of early readmission, patient centered care, measurement of targeted outcomes.\n High Performing Clinical Systems and Microsystems Approaches to Improvement – this category emphasizes structure and process in clinical care and healthcare as complex adaptive systems. Examples of Research Issues: Frontline provider engagement, factors related to uptake, adoption and implementation, sustaining improvements and improvement processes.\n Evidence-Based Quality Improvement and Best Practice – this category emphasizes closing the gap between knowledge and practice through transforming knowledge and designating and implementing best practices. Examples of Research Issues: Develop and critically appraise clinical practice guidelines, adoption and spread of best practices, customization of best practices, institutional elements in adoption, defining best practice in absence of evidence, consumers in EBP, technology-based integration.\n Learning Organizations and Culture of Quality and Safety – this category emphasizes human factors and other aspects of a system related to organizational culture and commitment to quality and safety. Examples of Research Issues: Unit based nursing quality teams, protecting strategy from culture, engendering values and beliefs for culture of patient safety.\n\nGovernance \nISRN is affiliated with the PBRN Resource Center of the Institute for Integration of Medicine and Science, University of Texas Health Science Center San Antonio. Through this alignment, ISRN addresses \"Translational Science 3\" (T3) phases of moving knowledge into practice.\n\nISRN is advised by the ISRN Steering Council. The Steering Council is composed of twelve healthcare experts, leaders, and stakeholders from both private and public agencies and facilities. .\n\nISRN activities are supported by a coordinating team housed in the School of Nursing.\n\nEvents\nWeb events\nThe first session of the ISRN web event series, \"The Way Forward: An Introduction to Improvement Science\", was held in June 2010.\n\nPresented by Jack Needleman, PhD, FAAN, and Kathleen R. Stevens, this introductory session showcased the activities of the ISRN as a catalyst for change. The discussion included definition of improvement science, exploration of the overlapping paradigms of improvement science, translational science, and implementation science and explanation of the need and context for improvement research and a discussion of improvement science research methods, study opportunities, and ISRN research results.",

    "title": "2015 Zvornik police station shooting",
    "clean_text": "The 2015 Zvornik police station shooting happened on April 27, 2015, when a gunman attacked a police station in Zvornik in the Republika Srpska entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina. He killed one police officer and wounded two others before being shot dead by other police officers. This was the first attack of its kind in Republika Srpska; attacks have occurred in the other entity, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, including the 1997 Mostar car bombing.\n\nPolice forces of Republika Srpska launched a counter-terrorist operation codenamed Operation Ruben, with the declared aim of disrupting targets suspected of possessing firearms and involvement in radical Islamist circles. The move was heavily criticised by several Bosniak politicians because of the absence of coordination with the central government, with some suggesting that the operation was calculated to intimidate Bosniak refugees who had returned to live on what is today Republika Srpska's territory.\n\nShooting \n\nNerdin Ibrić, born in 1991 in Sapna near Zvornik, drove up to the Zvornik police station at around 19:00. When a sentry told him that he could not park in front of the station, Ibrić produced a rifle and opened fire at the officer.\n\nSeveral Bosnian-language news portals claimed that Ibrić had never shouted \"Allahu akbar\", citing another news portal which only reported that he had shouted profanities and threats. However, the following day, the same portal reported that Ibrić had initially yelled profanities and threats, but then began shouting Allahu akbar.\n\nPolice officer Dragan Đurić was struck by several bullets, and killed. Ibrić then went inside the station and continued shooting, wounding two other officers, after which he was killed by the police. The wounded policemen were quickly transferred to the local hospital. Police believe that the attack was well-planned in advance, as Ibrić knew exactly when the officers' shifts switched, and thus began his spree when the most policemen would be inside the station.\n\nThe Minister of Interior of the Republika Srpska, Dragan Lukač, said that the assailant was probably a Wahhabist and called the shooting an act of terrorism. The President of Republika Srpska, Milorad Dodik, criticised police and security agencies at the state-level for not providing Bosnian Serb authorities with any useful information about potential terrorist plots prior to the attack. However, three days prior to the shooting, the Intelligence-Security Agency of Bosnia and Herzegovina (OSA-OBA BiH) had informed police agencies in the country that there was a possibility of a terrorist attack as retribution for the recent arrests of several individuals of Bosniak origin in Australia who had planned terrorist attacks there.\n\nIbrić was buried on 30 April 2015 at a local cemetery in Kučić Kula near Zvornik in accordance with religious rituals with several hundred people attending his funeral.\n\nInvestigation \n\nOn the day of the shooting, the State Investigation and Protection Agency (SIPA) had arrested Ibrić's friend, Avdulah Hasanović. Hasanović was previously arrested by SIPA during the anti-terrorist action Operation Damascus, as he was suspected of being a member of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). Hasanović was known to have participated in the Syrian Civil War in 2014. Another one of Ibrić's associates, Kasim Mehidić, was arrested. After a two-day interrogation, both Hasanović and Mehidić were handed over to the State Attorney of Bosnia and Herzegovina for further investigation. The Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina ordered that they be detained for one month under suspicion that they had recruited Ibrić for the attack.\n\nSoon after Ibrić's two friends were arrested, the police expanded its investigation to include other suspected radical Islamists, some of whom were also veterans of the Syrian Civil War. The police suspect that the village of Dubnica near Kalesija is one of the major gathering points of radical Islamists. Soon after the attack, Dodik met with Serbian President Tomislav Nikolić and Prime Minister Aleksandar Vučić, asking them for intelligence and counter-terrorism assistance.\n\nOn 6 May, the Republika Srpska launched Operation Ruben in order to root out suspected radical Islamists from the entity, detaining dozens of Muslim Bosniaks, as well as confiscating weapons, ammunition and propaganda material believed to be aimed to encourage Bosnian citizens to join fighters in Syria. The operation has been criticised by multiple Bosniak politicians, including Bakir Izetbegović who said that the Republika Srpska police had \"crossed the line\". The Mayor of Srebrenica said that the Serb police stormed the homes of Bosniaks who returned after the war and carried out arrests without explanation. He called it a \"form of repression\".\n\nPossible motives \n\nThe Presidency and the Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Government of Republika Srpska characterised the shooting as a terrorist attack. The United States Embassy to Bosnia and Herzegovina also referred to it as terrorism. The Office of the High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina condemned the attack in a press release but did not describe it as a terrorist operation.\n\nThe Sarajevo-based newspaper Dnevni avaz claimed the Bijeli Potok massacre that occurred on 1 June 1992 as a possible motive, when 668 Bosniaks of Zvornik, among whom was Ibrić's father Sejfo, were separated from their families and killed by the Army of Republika Srpska and police of Zvornik, with help of paramilitary units from Serbia. According to Balkan Insight, their names were mentioned among more than 850 Serb soldiers and policemen on a 2004 Republika Srpska government report on the Srebrenica massacres. However, one of the officials who made the report explained that it just listed military and police personnel who were on duty in 1995 in the territory between Zvornik and Višegrad (including Srebrenica); the official said that \"it is insane to claim that all of them committed war crimes\".",

The French name for a tasting menu is . Some restaurants and chefs specialize in tasting menus, while in other cases, it is a special or a menu option. Tasting menus may be offered to provide a sample of a type of cuisine, a house specialty, or to take advantage of fresh seasonal ingredients. \n\nComing to the mainstream in the 1990s, tasting menus evolved into elaborate showcases highlighting the culinary artistry of the chef. The trend traces back centuries, but some trace the latest evolution to the mid-1990s and two highly lauded restaurants, Chef Ferran Adrià's El Bulli in Spain, and Chef Thomas Keller's French Laundry, in Napa Valley, north of San Francisco in the U.S., that offered tasting menus of 40 courses or more.

    "clean_text": "Syvde is a former municipality in Møre og Romsdal county, Norway. The  municipality existed from 1918 until its dissolution in 1964. The area is now part of Vanylven Municipality in the traditional district of Sunnmøre. The administrative centre was the village of Myklebost, at the end of the Syvdsfjorden. Syvde Church was the municipal church.\n\nPrior to its dissolution in 1964, the  municipality was the 468th largest by area out of the 689 municipalities in Norway. Syvde Municipality was the 538th most populous municipality in Norway with a population of about 1,482. The municipality's population density was  and its population had increased by 2.5% over the previous 10-year period.\n\nGeneral information\nThe municipality of Søvde (later spelled Syvde) was established on 1 February 1918 when the old Vanylven Municipality was split into two municipalities: Vanyvlen Municipality (population: 1,848) in the west and the new Søvde Municipality (population: 1,260) in the east.\n\nDuring the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, Syvde Municipality was dissolved and the following areas were merged to form a new, larger Vanylven Municipality:\nall of Syvde Municipality (population: 1,458)\nthe portion of Rovde Municipality that was located south of the Rovdefjorden (population: 436)\nall of Vanylven Municipality (population: 2,003)\n\nName\nThe municipality is named after the local fjord, Syvdsfjorden (). The name is likely derived from the word  which means \"to swerve\" or \"to drift\", probably referring to the crooked or bent shape of the fjord. Historically, the name was spelled Søvde.\n\nChurches\nThe Church of Norway had one parish () within Syvde Municipality. At the time of the municipal dissolution, it was part of the Vanylven prestegjeld and the Søre Sunnmøre prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Bjørgvin.\n\nChurches in SyvdeParish ()Church nameLocation of the churchYear builtSyvdeSyvde ChurchSyvde1837\n\nGeography\nThe municipality included the areas surrounding the Syvdsfjorden. The highest point in the municipality was the  tall mountain Storeblæja. Rovde Municipality was located to the northeast, Dalsfjord Municipality was located to the east and south, Vanylven Municipality was located to the west, and Sande Municipality was located to the northwest.\n\nGovernment\nSyvde Municipality was responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, welfare and other social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads and utilities. The municipality was governed by a municipal council of directly elected representatives. The mayor was indirectly elected by a vote of the municipal council. The municipality was under the jurisdiction of the Frostating Court of Appeal.   \n\nMunicipal council\nThe municipal council  of Syvde was made up of 17 representatives that were elected to four year terms. The tables below show the historical composition of the council by political party. \n\nMayors\nThe mayor () of Syvde was the political leader of the municipality and the chairperson of the municipal council.

He made his Ligue 1 debut on 11 December 2015 against SM Caen, as an 84th-minute substitute for Juan Fernando Quintero in a 1–1 home draw.\n\nJanvier signed his first professional contract in August 2015, a three-year deal that made him only the third 17-year-old to turn professional at Rennes, after Yoann Gourcuff and Damien Le Tallec. He made only 15 appearances in all competitions (four starts), being used mainly in the reserve team in the Championnat National 3 and 2. He left in August 2019 on a three-year deal to Vitória SC in Portugal's Primeira Liga.\n\nJanvier was again a reserve in his first year in Portugal, scoring 8 goals in 23 games including braces in wins over CDC Montalegre and Berço SC. He made his Primeira Liga debut on 18 September 2020, playing the full 90 minutes of a 1–0 home loss to B-SAD, the first game managed by Tiago Mendes.\n\nOn 4 July 2023, Janvier signed a three-year contract for Turkish club Alanyaspor, for an undisclosed fee.\n\nInternational career\nJanvier earned 53 caps for France at youth level, scoring 16 goals. He made his debut on 17 September 2013 with the under-16 team in a 1–0 friendly win over Wales in La Sauvetat-du-Dropt, and scored in a 6–0 win against the same country two days later. He was part of the under-17 team that won the 2015 UEFA European Championship  in Bulgaria, though he missed in the semi-final penalty shootout against Belgium.\n\nHonours\nFrance\nUEFA European Under-17 Championship: 2015",
